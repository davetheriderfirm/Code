introduction


it
is
a
melancholy
but
instructive
fact
to
remember
that
in
the
opinion
of
him
whom
nature
had
adorned
with
the
greatest
intellect
that
the
world
has
yet
seen
selfishness
and
selfinterest
lie
at
the
root
of
all
human
action
for
as
napoleon
said
in
ambition
is
to
be
found
the
chief
motive
force
of
humanity
and
a
man
puts
forth
his
best
powers
in
proportion
to
his
hopes
of
advancement
it
was
on
this
cynical
hypothesis
therefore
with
a
complete
disregard
of
those
higher
aspirations
of
selfsacrifice
and
selfcontrol
which
raise
man
above
the
mere
brute
that
the
corsican
adventurer
waded
through
seas
of
blood
to
the
throne
of
france
and
then
attempted
by
the
destruction
of
a
million
human
beings
to
bind
on
his
brow
the
imperial
crown
of
western
europe
in
spite
of
loudsounding
phrases
and
constitutional
sleightofhand
none
knew
better
than
napoleon
that
by
the
sword
alone
he
had
won
his
empire
and
by
the
sword
alone
he
could
keep
it
keen
student
of
history
it
was
not
in
vain
that
again
and
again
he
had
read
and
reread
the
works
of
cæsar
and
pondered
on
the
achievements
of
charlemagne
and
the
career
of
cromwell
the
problem
he
had
to
solve
was
how
to
conceal
from
his
lieutenants
that
his
dynasty
rested
purely
on
their
swords
to
bind
their
honours
so
closely
to
his
own
fortune
that
they
should
ever
be
loyal
so
to
distribute
his
favours
that
his
servants
should
never
become
so
great
as
to
threaten
his
own
position
it
was
with
this
object
in
view
that
at
the
time
he
seized
for
himself
the
imperial
crown
he
reestablished
the
old
rôle
of
marshal
of
france
frankly
confessing
to
roederer
that
his
reason
for
showering
rewards
on
his
lieutenants
was
to
assure
to
himself
his
own
dignity
since
they
could
not
object
to
it
when
they
found
themselves
the
recipients
of
such
lofty
titles
but
with
the
cunning
of
the
serpent
while
he
gave
with
one
hand
he
took
away
with
the
other
he
fixed
the
number
of
marshals
at
sixteen
on
the
active
list
and
added
four
others
for
those
too
old
for
active
service
hence
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
reward
twenty
hungry
aspirants
while
he
robbed
the
individuals
of
their
glory
since
each
marshal
shared
his
dignity
with
nineteen
others
plainly
also
he
told
them
that
lofty
though
their
rank
might
appear
to
others
to
him
they
were
still
mere
servants
created
by
him
and
dependent
for
their
position
on
him
alone
recollect
he
said
that
you
are
soldiers
only
when
with
the
army
the
title
of
marshal
is
merely
a
civil
distinction
which
gives
you
the
honourable
rank
at
my
court
which
is
your
due
but
it
carries
with
it
no
authority
on
the
battlefield
you
are
generals
at
court
you
are
nobles
belonging
to
the
state
by
the
civil
position
i
created
for
you
when
i
bestowed
your
titles
on
you
it
was
on
may
19
1804
that
the
gazette
appeared
with
the
first
creation
of
marshals
there
were
fourteen
on
the
active
list
and
four
honorary
marshals
in
the
senate
two
bâtons
were
withheld
as
a
reward
for
future
service
the
original
fourteen
were
berthier
murat
moncey
jourdan
masséna
augereau
bernadotte
soult
brune
lannes
mortier
ney
davout
and
bessières
while
on
the
retired
list
were
kellermann
lefèbvre
pérignon
and
serurier
the
list
caused
much
surprise
and
dissatisfaction
on
the
one
hand
there
were
those
like
masséna
who
received
their
congratulations
with
a
grunt
and
yes
one
of
fourteen
on
the
other
hand
were
those
like
macdonald
marmont
victor
and
many
another
who
thought
they
ought
to
have
been
included
an
examination
of
the
names
soon
explains
how
the
choice
was
made
except
jourdan
who
was
too
great
a
soldier
to
be
passed
over
all
those
who
could
not
forget
their
republican
principles
were
excluded
masséna
received
his
bâton
as
the
greatest
soldier
of
france
berthier
murat
and
lannes
had
won
theirs
by
their
talents
as
much
as
by
their
personal
devotion
soult
ney
davout
and
mortier
were
napoleons
choice
from
among
the
coming
men
who
in
the
camps
of
the
army
of
the
ocean
were
fast
justifying
their
selection
bessières
was
included
because
he
would
never
win
it
at
any
later
date
but
his
doglike
devotion
made
him
a
priceless
subordinate
augereau
and
bernadotte
received
their
bâtons
to
keep
them
quiet
the
names
of
moncey
brune
kellermann
pérignon
and
serurier
were
intimately
connected
with
glorious
feats
of
the
republican
armies
and
so
though
only
fortunate
mediocrities
they
were
included
in
the
first
creation
while
lefèbvre
the
republican
of
republicans
now
under
the
glamour
of
napoleons
power
was
placed
on
the
list
as
a
stalkinghorse
of
the
extreme
members
of
his
party
at
the
time
of
the
first
creation
of
the
great
soldiers
of
the
republic
moreau
was
branded
as
a
traitor
hoche
marceau
kléber
desaix
and
pichegru
were
dead
carnot
the
organiser
of
victory
was
a
voluntary
exile
while
staunch
blades
like
leclerc
richepanse
lecourbe
macdonald
victor
st
cyr
and
suchet
were
all
more
or
less
in
disgrace
by
the
end
of
the
empire
death
and
the
necessity
of
rewarding
merit
added
to
the
list
of
marshals
until
in
all
twentysix
bâtons
were
granted
by
the
emperor
in
1808
victor
was
restored
to
favour
and
received
his
bâton
after
wagram
macdonald
oudinot
and
marmont
received
the
prize
while
the
spanish
war
brought
it
to
suchet
and
the
russian
campaign
to
st
cyr
in
1813
the
polish
prince
poniatowski
was
sent
his
truncheon
on
the
field
of
leipzig
while
last
of
all
in
1815
grouchy
was
promoted
to
one
of
the
vacancies
caused
by
the
refusal
of
many
of
the
marshals
to
cast
off
their
allegiance
to
the
bourbons

it
was
a
popular
saying
in
the
napoleonic
army
that
every
private
soldier
carried
in
his
knapsack
a
marshals
bâton
and
the
early
history
of
many
of
these
marshals
bears
out
this
saying
but
while
the
revolution
carried
away
all
the
barriers
and
opened
the
highest
ranks
to
talent
be
it
never
so
humble
in
its
origin
the
history
of
the
marshals
proves
that
heavenborn
soldiers
are
scarce
and
that
the
art
of
war
save
in
the
case
of
one
out
of
a
million
can
only
be
acquired
by
years
of
patient
work
in
a
subordinate
position
of
the
generals
of
the
revolutionary
armies
only
four
moreau
mortier
suchet
and
brune
had
no
previous
military
training
and
of
these
four
moreau
and
suchet
alone
had
claim
to
greatness
the
rough
unlettered
generals
of
the
early
years
of
the
war
soon
proved
that
they
could
never
rise
above
the
science
of
the
drillsergeant
once
discipline
and
organisation
were
restored
there
was
no
room
for
a
general
like
the
gallant
macard
who
when
about
to
charge
used
to
call
out
look
here
i
am
going
to
dress
like
a
beast
and
thereon
divest
himself
of
everything
save
his
leather
breeches
and
boots
and
then
like
some
great
hairy
baboon
with
strange
oaths
and
yells
lead
his
horsemen
against
the
enemy
a
higher
type
was
required
than
this
macard
who
could
not
understand
that
because
an
officer
could
sketch
mountains
he
could
not
necessarily
measure
a
man
for
a
pair
of
boots

of
the
twentysix
marshals
nine
had
held
commissions
ranging
from
lieutenantgeneral
to
lieutenant
in
the
old
royal
army
one
was
a
polish
prince
an
exaustrian
officer
while
one
had
passed
the
artillery
college
but
had
refused
to
accept
a
commission
eleven
had
commenced
life
as
privates
in
the
old
service
and
of
these
nine
had
risen
to
the
rank
of
sergeant
and
four
had
had
no
previous
military
training
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
the
standard
of
the
noncommissioned
rank
in
the
royal
army
just
before
the
revolution
was
extremely
high
the
reforms
of
st
germain
and
the
popularity
of
the
american
war
had
enticed
into
the
ranks
a
high
class
of
recruits
with
the
result
that
the
authorities
were
able
to
impose
tests
and
no
private
could
rise
to
the
rank
of
corporal
or
from
corporal
to
sergeant
without
passing
an
examination
further
since
the
officers
of
the
ancient
régime
left
the
entire
organisation
discipline
and
control
in
the
hands
of
the
noncommissioned
officers
and
seldom
if
ever
visited
their
companies
either
in
barracks
or
on
the
parade
ground
the
noncommissioned
officers
in
everything
save
actual
title
were
really
extremely
welltrained
officers
it
was
this
class
which
really
saved
france
when
the
old
officers
emigrated
and
the
incapable
politicians
in
paris
did
their
best
to
ruin
the
army
hence
it
was
that
without
prejudice
to
the
service
a
sergeant
might
one
day
be
found
quietly
obeying
the
orders
of
his
company
officer
and
the
next
day
with
the
rank
of
lieutenantcolonel
commanding
his
battalion

the
art
of
war
can
only
be
truly
learned
in
the
field
and
the
officers
of
the
french
army
had
such
an
experience
as
had
never
fallen
to
the
lot
of
any
other
nation
since
the
days
of
the
thirty
years
war
with
continuous
fighting
winter
and
summer
on
every
frontier
military
knowledge
was
easily
gained
by
those
who
had
the
ability
to
acquire
it
and
the
young
generals
of
brigade
with
but
three
years
service
in
commissioned
rank
had
gone
through
experiences
which
seldom
fall
to
the
lot
of
officers
with
thirty
years
service
the
cycle
of
war
seemed
unending
from
the
day
on
which
in
1792
france
hurled
her
declaration
of
war
on
austria
till
the
surrender
of
paris
in
1814
with
the
exception
of
the
year
of
peace
gained
at
amiens
war
was
continuous
it
began
with
a
lighthearted
invasion
of
france
by
austria
and
prussia
in
september
1792
which
ended
in
the
cannonade
of
valmy
when
dumouriez
and
kellermann
with
the
remnant
of
the
old
royal
army
showed
such
a
bold
front
that
the
allies
who
had
never
expected
to
fight
lost
heart
and
ran
home
the
austroprussian
invasion
sealed
the
kings
deathwarrant
and
france
in
the
hands
of
republican
enthusiasts
went
forth
with
a
rabble
of
old
soldiers
and
volunteers
to
preach
the
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
man
and
the
brotherhood
of
nations
but
the
sovereigns
of
europe
determined
to
fight
for
their
crowns
and
the
licence
of
the
french
soldiers
and
the
selfishness
of
these
prophets
of
the
new
doctrine
of
equality
soon
disgusted
the
people
of
the
rhine
valley
so
the
revolutionary
mob
armies
were
driven
into
france
and
for
two
years
she
was
busy
on
every
frontier
striving
to
drive
the
enemy
from
her
soil
it
was
during
these
years
that
the
new
french
army
arose
the
volunteers
were
brigaded
with
the
old
regular
battalions
the
ranks
were
kept
full
by
calling
out
all
fit
to
bear
arms
and
the
incompetent
and
unfortunate
were
weeded
out
by
the
guillotine
by
1795
france
had
freed
her
own
soil
and
had
forged
a
weapon
whereby
she
could
retaliate
on
the
powers
who
had
attempted
to
annex
her
territory
in
the
hour
of
her
degradation
the
rhine
now
became
her
eastern
frontier
but
austria
whose
archduke
was
emperor
of
the
holy
roman
empire
would
not
give
up
the
provinces
seized
from
her
so
from
1795
to
1797
on
the
headwaters
of
the
danube
and
in
italy
the
representative
of
the
feudal
ages
fought
the
new
democracy
it
was
the
appearance
of
the
great
military
talent
of
bonaparte
which
decided
the
day
on
the
danube
the
austrians
had
found
that
under
the
excellent
leading
of
the
archduke
charles
they
were
fit
to
defeat
the
best
french
troops
under
capable
generals
like
jourdan
and
moreau
but
the
military
genius
of
bonaparte
overbore
all
resistance
and
when
peace
came
practically
all
italy
had
been
added
to
the
dominion
of
france
unfortunately
for
the
peace
of
europe
the
rulers
of
france
had
tasted
blood
they
found
in
the
captured
provinces
a
means
of
making
war
without
feeling
the
effects
for
the
rich
pillage
of
italy
paid
the
war
expenses
but
grateful
as
the
directors
were
to
bonaparte
for
thus
opening
to
them
a
means
of
enriching
themselves
at
the
expense
of
europe
they
rightly
saw
in
him
a
menace
to
their
own
power
and
gladly
allowed
him
to
depart
on
the
mission
to
egypt
from
egypt
bonaparte
returned
seized
the
reins
of
government
and
saved
france
from
the
imbecility
of
her
rulers
and
by
the
battle
of
marengo
assured
to
her
all
she
had
lost
in
his
absence
unfortunately
for
france
the
restless
ambition
of
her
new
ruler
was
not
satisfied
with
reestablishing
the
empire
of
the
west
and
reviving
the
glories
of
charlemagne
but
hankered
after
a
vast
oversea
dominion
to
include
america
and
india
hence
it
was
that
he
found
in
great
britain
an
implacable
enemy
ever
stirring
up
against
him
european
coalitions
to
cover
his
failure
to
wrest
the
dominion
of
the
sea
from
its
mistress
napoleon
turned
his
wrath
on
austria
and
soon
she
lay
cowed
at
his
feet
after
the
catastrophe
at
ulm
and
the
battle
of
austerlitz
austrias
fall
was
due
to
the
lethargy
and
hesitation
of
the
courts
of
berlin
and
st
petersburg
but
once
austria
was
disposed
of
prussia
and
russia
met
their
punishment
for
having
given
her
secret
or
open
aid
the
storm
fell
first
on
prussia
at
one
fell
swoop
on
the
field
of
jena
the
famed
military
monarchy
of
the
great
frederick
fell
in
pieces
like
a
potters
vessel
from
prussia
the
invincible
french
legions
penetrated
into
poland
and
after
eylau
and
friedland
the
forces
of
prussia
and
russia
could
no
longer
face
the
enemy
in
the
field
the
czar
dazzled
by
napoleons
greatness
threw
over
his
ally
prussia
and
at
tilsit
made
friends
with
the
great
conqueror
in
june
1807
it
seemed
as
if
europe
lay
at
napoleons
feet
but
already
in
portugal
the
seeds
of
his
ruin
had
been
sown
the
portuguese
monarch
the
ally
of
great
britain
fled
at
the
mere
approach
of
a
single
marshal
of
the
emperor
the
apparent
lethargy
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
iberian
peninsula
and
the
unpopularity
of
the
spanish
bourbons
tempted
napoleon
to
establish
his
brother
on
the
throne
of
spain
it
was
a
fatal
error
for
though
the
spanish
people
might
despise
their
king
they
were
intensely
proud
of
their
nationality
for
the
first
time
in
his
experience
the
corsican
had
to
meet
the
forces
of
a
nation
and
not
of
a
government
the
chance
defeat
of
a
french
army
at
baylen
was
the
signal
for
a
general
rising
throughout
the
peninsula
and
not
only
throughout
the
peninsula
but
for
the
commencement
of
a
national
movement
against
the
french
in
austria
and
germany
england
gladly
seized
the
opportunity
of
injuring
her
enemy
and
sent
aid
to
the
people
of
spain
austria
tried
another
fall
with
her
conqueror
but
was
defeated
at
wagram
wagram
ought
to
have
taught
the
emperor
that
his
troops
were
no
longer
invincible
as
of
old
but
blind
to
this
lesson
he
still
attempted
to
lord
it
over
europe
and
treated
with
contumely
his
only
friend
the
czar
consequently
in
1812
while
still
engaged
in
attempting
to
conquer
spain
he
found
himself
forced
to
fight
russia
the
result
was
appalling
out
of
half
a
million
troops
who
entered
russia
a
bare
seventy
thousand
returned
prussia
and
austria
at
once
made
a
bid
to
recover
their
independence
napoleon
blinded
by
rage
refused
to
listen
to
reason
and
in
october
1813
was
defeated
by
the
allies
at
leipzig
even
then
he
might
have
saved
his
throne
but
he
still
refused
to
listen
to
the
allies
who
in
1814
invaded
france
and
after
a
campaign
in
which
the
emperor
showed
an
almost
superhuman
ability
at
last
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
they
captured
paris
thereon
the
french
troops
refused
to
fight
any
longer
for
the
emperor
such
is
a
brief
outline
of
what
is
called
the
revolutionary
and
napoleonic
wars
the
finest
school
the
world
has
yet
seen
for
an
apprenticeship
in
the
trade
of
arms

napoleons
marshals

i

louis
alexandre
berthier
marshal
prince
of
wagram
sovereign
prince
of
neuchâtel
and
valangin


to
be
content
ever
to
play
an
inferior
part
to
see
all
honour
and
renown
fall
to
the
share
of
another
yet
loyally
to
efface
self
and
work
for
the
glory
of
a
friend
denotes
a
sterling
character
and
an
inflexibility
of
purpose
with
which
few
can
claim
to
be
endowed
nobody
doubts
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
napoleon
berthier
good
business
man
as
he
was
could
never
have
risen
to
the
fame
he
attained
still
it
is
often
forgotten
that
without
this
admirable
servant
it
is
more
than
doubtful
if
the
great
emperor
could
have
achieved
all
his
most
splendid
success
berthier
controlled
by
a
master
mind
was
an
instrument
beyond
price
versed
in
the
management
of
an
army
almost
from
his
cradle
he
had
the
gift
of
drafting
orders
so
clear
so
lucid
that
no
one
could
possibly
mistake
their
meaning
his
memory
was
prodigious
and
his
physical
endurance
such
that
he
appeared
never
to
require
rest
but
above
all
he
alone
seemed
to
be
able
to
divine
the
thoughts
of
his
great
master
before
they
were
spoken
and
this
wonderful
intuition
taught
him
how
from
a
few
disjointed
utterances
to
unravel
napoleons
most
daring
conceptions
and
work
out
the
details
in
ordered
perfection
napoleon
called
his
faithful
achates
a
gosling
whom
he
had
transformed
into
an
eagle
but
history
proclaims
that
long
before
the
name
of
bonaparte
was
known
beyond
the
gate
of
the
military
academy
at
brienne
berthier
had
established
a
record
as
a
staff
officer
of
the
highest
promise
while
before
the
young
corsican
first
met
him
in
italy
the
future
majorgeneral
of
the
grand
army
had
evolved
that
perfect
system
of
organisation
which
enabled
the
conqueror
of
italy
to
control
every
movement
and
vibration
in
the
army
to
be
informed
of
events
as
soon
as
they
happened
and
to
be
absolutely
sure
of
the
despatch
and
performance
of
his
orders

alexandre
berthier
had
seen
twentythree
years
service
in
the
old
royal
army
before
the
revolution
broke
out
in
1789
born
on
november
20
1753
at
the
age
of
thirteen
he
received
his
commission
in
the
engineers
owing
to
his
fathers
services
in
preparing
a
map
of
royal
hunting
forests
but
the
boy
soon
forsook
his
fathers
old
regiment
for
he
knew
well
that
the
highest
commands
in
the
army
seldom
if
ever
fell
to
the
scientific
corps
when
in
1780
the
french
government
decided
to
send
out
an
expeditionary
corps
to
assist
the
revolted
colonies
in
their
struggle
with
great
britain
berthier
after
serving
in
the
infantry
and
cavalry
was
employed
as
a
staff
captain
with
the
army
of
normandy
eager
to
see
active
service
he
at
once
applied
to
be
attached
to
the
expedition
and
offered
if
there
was
no
room
for
an
extra
captain
to
resign
his
rank
and
serve
as
sublieutenant
thanks
to
powerful
family
influence
and
to
his
record
of
service
his
desire
was
gratified
and
in
january
1781
he
found
himself
with
the
french
troops
in
america
employed
on
the
staff
of
general
count
de
rochambeau
returning
from
america
in
1783
with
a
wellearned
reputation
for
bravery
and
ability
captain
berthier
was
one
of
the
officers
sent
to
prussia
under
the
marquis
de
custine
to
study
the
military
organisation
of
the
great
frederick
continuously
employed
on
the
staff
he
had
the
advantage
of
serving
as
brigade
major
at
the
great
camp
of
instruction
held
at
saint
omer
in
1788
and
in
that
year
received
as
a
reward
for
his
services
the
cross
of
saint
louis
the
year
1789
saw
him
gazetted
lieutenantcolonel
and
chief
of
the
staff
to
baron
de
besenval
commanding
the
troops
round
paris

when
after
the
capture
of
the
bastille
lafayette
undertook
the
work
of
organising
the
national
guard
he
at
once
bethought
him
of
his
old
comrade
of
american
days
and
appointed
berthier
assistant
quartermastergeneral
berthier
found
the
post
well
suited
to
him
inspired
by
the
liberal
ideas
which
he
had
gained
in
america
he
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
work
soon
his
talent
as
an
organiser
became
widely
recognised
many
prominent
officers
applied
to
have
him
attached
to
their
command
and
after
holding
several
staff
appointments
he
was
entrusted
in
1791
with
the
organisation
and
instruction
of
the
thirty
battalions
of
volunteers
cantonned
between
the
somme
and
meuse
when
war
broke
out
in
1792
he
was
despatched
as
majorgeneral
and
chief
of
the
staff
to
his
old
friend
rochambeau
and
when
the
count
resigned
his
command
berthier
was
specially
retained
by
rochambeaus
successor
luckner
but
the
revolution
while
giving
him
his
chance
nearly
brought
about
his
fall
his
intimate
connection
with
the
nobles
of
the
old
royal
army
his
courage
in
protecting
the
kings
aunts
and
his
family
connections
caused
him
to
become
suspect
it
was
in
vain
that
the
leaders
at
the
front
complained
of
the
absolute
disorder
in
their
forces
of
the
necessity
of
more
trained
staff
officers
and
of
their
desire
for
the
services
of
the
brilliant
soldier
who
had
gained
his
experience
in
war
time
in
america
and
in
peace
time
in
prussia
in
vain
custine
wrote
to
the
minister
of
war
in
the
name
of
the
republic
send
berthier
to
me
to
help
me
in
my
difficulties
in
vain
the
commissioners
with
the
army
reported
that
berthier
has
gained
the
esteem
and
confidence
of
all
good
patriots
vain
also
was
the
valour
and
ability
he
showed
in
the
campaign
against
the
royalists
in
la
vendée
bouchotte
the
incapable
the
friend
of
the
brutish
blockheaded
hébert
the
insulter
of
the
queen
the
destroyer
of
the
army
decreed
that
his
loyalty
to
the
republic
was
not
sincere
and
by
a
stroke
of
the
pen
dismissed
him
thus
during
the
whole
of
the
year
1793
the
french
army
was
deprived
of
the
service
of
an
officer
who
owing
to
his
powers
of
organisation
was
worth
fifty
thousand
of
the
butcher
generals

in
1795
with
the
fall
of
the
jacobins
berthier
was
restored
to
his
rank
and
sent
as
chief
of
the
staff
to
kellermann
commanding
the
army
of
the
alps
and
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
staff
work
of
kellermanns
army
became
the
pattern
for
all
the
armies
of
the
republic
when
in
march
1796
bonaparte
was
appointed
commander
of
the
army
of
italy
he
at
once
requisitioned
berthier
as
the
chief
of
the
staff
and
from
that
day
till
april
1814
berthier
seldom
if
ever
left
the
future
emperors
side
serving
him
with
a
patience
and
cheerfulness
which
neither
illwill
nor
neglect
seemed
to
disturb
though
over
fortytwo
years
of
age
and
sixteen
years
older
than
his
new
chief
the
chief
of
the
staff
was
still
in
the
prime
of
his
manhood
short
thickset
and
athletic
his
frame
proclaimed
his
immense
physical
strength
while
his
strong
alert
face
under
a
mass
of
thick
curly
hair
foretold
at
a
glance
his
mental
capacity

a
keen
sportsman
in
peace
he
spent
all
his
leisure
in
the
chase
hard
exercise
and
feats
of
physical
endurance
were
his
delight
fatigue
he
never
knew
and
on
one
occasion
he
was
said
to
have
spent
thirteen
days
and
nights
in
the
saddle
to
strangers
and
officials
he
was
silent
and
stern
but
his
aloofness
of
manner
hid
a
warm
heart
and
a
natural
sincerity
and
many
a
poor
officer
or
returned
émigré
received
secret
help
from
his
purse
though
naturally
of
a
strong
character
his
affection
and
respect
for
his
great
commander
became
the
dominating
note
in
his
career
in
fact
it
might
almost
be
said
that
in
later
years
his
personality
became
merged
to
such
an
extent
in
that
of
napoleon
that
he
was
unable
to
see
the
actions
of
the
emperor
in
their
proper
perspective
from
their
first
meeting
bonaparte
correctly
guessed
the
impression
he
had
made
on
his
new
staff
officer
and
aimed
at
increasing
his
influence
over
him
meanwhile
he
was
delighted
with
him
he
wrote
to
the
directory
berthier
has
talents
activity
courage
characterall
in
his
favour
berthier
on
his
side
was
well
satisfied
as
he
said
to
a
friend
who
asked
him
how
he
could
serve
a
man
with
such
a
temper
remember
that
one
day
it
will
be
a
fine
thing
to
be
second
to
bonaparte
so
the
two
worked
admirably
together

bonaparte
kept
in
his
own
hands
the
movement
of
troops
the
direction
of
skirmishes
and
battles
commissariat
discipline
and
all
communications
from
the
government
berthier
had
a
free
hand
in
the
organisation
and
maintenance
of
the
general
staff
the
headquarter
staff
and
the
transmission
of
orders
subject
to
inspection
by
bonaparte
he
also
had
to
throw
into
written
form
all
verbal
orders
and
he
alone
was
responsible
for
their
promulgation
and
execution
it
was
his
ability
to
work
out
in
detail
and
to
reduce
into
clear
lucid
orders
the
slightest
hint
of
his
commander
which
as
napoleon
said
later
was
the
great
merit
of
berthier
and
was
of
inestimable
importance
to
me
no
other
could
possibly
have
replaced
him
thanks
to
berthiers
admirable
system
bonaparte
was
kept
in
touch
with
every
part
of
his
command
one
of
the
first
principles
laid
down
in
the
staff
regulations
was
that
it
was
vital
to
the
good
of
the
service
that
the
correspondence
of
the
army
should
be
exceedingly
swift
and
regular
that
nothing
should
be
neglected
which
might
contribute
to
this
end
to
ensure
regularity
of
communication
divisional
commanders
and
officers
detached
in
command
of
small
columns
were
ordered
to
report
at
least
twice
a
day
to
headquarters
with
each
division
in
addition
to
the
divisional
staff
there
were
officers
detached
from
the
headquarters
staff
all
important
despatches
had
to
be
sent
in
duplicate
in
times
of
great
danger
commanding
officers
had
to
send
as
many
as
eight
different
orderly
officers
each
with
a
copy
of
despatches

but
it
was
not
only
as
an
organiser
and
transmitter
of
orders
that
berthier
proved
his
usefulness
to
his
chief
at
lodi
he
showed
his
personal
courage
and
bravery
among
the
band
of
heroes
who
forced
the
bridge
and
bonaparte
paid
him
a
fine
tribute
when
he
wrote
in
his
despatches
if
i
were
bound
to
mention
all
the
soldiers
who
distinguished
themselves
on
that
wonderful
day
i
should
be
obliged
to
mention
all
the
carabiniers
and
grenadiers
of
the
advance
guard
and
nearly
all
the
officers
of
the
staff
but
i
must
not
forget
the
courageous
berthier
who
on
that
day
played
the
part
of
gunner
trooper
and
grenadier
at
rivoli
in
addition
to
his
staff
duties
berthier
commanded
the
centre
of
the
army
and
fought
with
a
stubbornness
beyond
all
praise
by
the
end
of
the
campaign
of
1796
he
had
proved
that
he
was
as
great
a
chief
of
the
staff
as
bonaparte
was
a
great
commander
doubtless
it
is
true
that
before
the
commencement
of
a
campaign
an
army
possesses
in
itself
the
causes
of
its
future
victory
or
defeat
and
the
army
of
italy
with
its
masses
of
enthusiastic
veterans
and
the
directing
genius
of
bonaparte
was
bound
to
defeat
the
austrians
with
their
listless
men
and
incompetent
old
generals
but
without
the
zeal
activity
and
devotion
which
berthier
transfused
through
the
whole
of
the
general
staff
success
could
not
have
been
so
sudden
or
so
complete

after
leoben
the
conqueror
of
italy
employed
his
trusty
friend
on
numerous
diplomatic
missions
in
connection
with
the
annexation
of
corfu
and
the
government
of
the
cisalpine
republic
meanwhile
he
was
in
close
communication
with
him
in
regard
to
the
proposed
descent
on
england
and
the
possible
expedition
to
the
east
to
berthier
if
to
any
one
bonaparte
entrusted
his
secret
designs
for
he
knew
that
he
could
do
so
in
safety
accordingly
in
1798
finding
an
invasion
of
england
impossible
at
the
moment
he
persuaded
the
directory
to
send
berthier
to
italy
as
commanderinchief
his
object
being
to
place
him
in
a
position
to
gather
funds
for
the
egyptian
expedition
from
italy
berthier
sent
his
former
commander
the
most
minute
description
of
everything
of
importance
but
he
found
the
task
difficult
and
uncongenial
and
prayed
him
to
recall
me
promptly
i
much
prefer
being
your
aidedecamp
to
being
commanderinchief
here
still
he
carried
out
his
orders
and
marched
on
rome
to
place
the
eight
million
francs
worth
of
diamonds
wrung
from
the
pope
to
the
credit
of
the
army
from
rome
he
returned
with
coffers
well
filled
for
the
egyptian
expedition
but
leaving
behind
him
an
army
halfmutinous
for
want
of
pay
his
blind
devotion
to
bonaparte
hid
this
incongruity
from
his
eyes

as
in
italy
in
1795
so
in
egypt
berthier
was
bonapartes
righthand
man
methodical
indefatigable
and
trustworthy
but
even
his
iron
frame
could
scarcely
withstand
the
strain
of
three
years
continuous
active
service
the
incessant
office
work
day
and
night
and
the
trials
of
an
unaccustomed
climate
after
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
he
fell
sick
and
before
the
syrian
expedition
applied
to
return
to
france
unkind
friends
hinted
that
he
longed
for
his
mistress
madame
visconti
but
bonaparte
knowing
that
it
was
not
this
but
sheer
overstrain
which
had
caused
his
breakdown
in
health
gave
him
the
desired
leave
and
made
all
arrangements
for
his
journey
home
however
at
the
moment
of
departure
berthiers
love
for
his
chief
overcame
his
longing
for
rest
and
in
spite
of
illhealth
he
withdrew
his
resignation
and
set
out
with
the
army
for
syria
as
ever
he
found
plenty
of
work
for
even
in
the
face
of
the
illsuccess
of
the
expedition
bonaparte
determined
to
administer
egypt
as
if
the
french
occupation
was
to
be
for
ever
permanent
and
berthier
in
addition
to
his
ordinary
work
was
ordered
to
edit
a
carefully
executed
map
from
the
complete
survey
which
was
being
made
of
the
country

it
was
to
berthier
that
bonaparte
first
divulged
his
intention
of
leaving
egypt
and
returning
to
france
and
his
determination
to
upset
the
directory
liberal
by
nature
but
essentially
a
man
of
method
and
a
disciplinarian
the
chief
of
the
staff
was
quite
in
accord
with
his
commanders
ideas
on
the
regeneration
of
france
and
loyally
supported
him
during
the
coup
détat
of
the
18th
brumaire
thereafter
the
first
consul
appointed
his
friend
minister
of
war
a
position
that
gave
full
scope
to
his
talents
all
the
administrative
services
had
at
once
to
be
reorganised
the
frontier
fortresses
garrisoned
and
placed
in
a
state
of
defence
and
the
army
covering
the
frontiers
supplied
with
food
pay
equipment
and
reinforcements
while
the
formation
of
the
secret
army
of
reserve
was
a
task
which
alone
would
have
occupied
all
the
attention
of
an
ordinary
man
in
fact
the
safety
of
france
hung
on
this
army
consequently
since
by
the
constitution
the
first
consul
was
unable
himself
to
take
command
in
the
field
in
april
1800
he
transferred
berthier
from
the
war
office
to
the
head
of
this
most
important
force
it
is
not
generally
known
that
the
idea
of
the
passage
of
the
alps
by
the
st
bernard
pass
actually
originated
with
berthier
and
had
first
been
projected
by
him
as
early
as
1795
so
it
was
at
the
execution
of
what
was
really
his
own
idea
that
for
two
months
berthier
slaved
at
times
even
his
stout
heart
quailed
as
when
he
wrote
to
the
first
consul
it
is
my
duty
to
complain
of
the
position
of
this
army
on
which
you
have
justly
spent
so
much
interest
and
which
is
paralysed
because
it
can
only
rely
on
its
bayonets
on
account
of
the
lack
of
ammunition
and
means
to
transport
the
artillery
incessant
work
and
toil
were
at
last
rewarded
but
when
the
army
of
the
reserve
debouched
on
the
austrian
lines
of
communication
the
first
consul
appeared
in
person
and
though
nominally
in
command
berthier
once
again
resumed
his
position
of
chief
of
the
staff
without
a
murmur
he
allowed
bonaparte
to
reap
all
the
glory
of
marengo
for
he
knew
that
without
the
first
consul
however
excellent
his
own
dispositions
were
they
would
have
been
lacking
in
the
driving
power
which
alone
teaches
men
how
to
seize
on
victory
after
marengo
berthier
was
despatched
as
ambassador
extraordinary
to
madrid
to
exhort
spain
by
every
possible
means
to
declare
war
on
portugal
the
ally
of
england
the
result
of
this
mission
was
eminently
successful
a
special
treaty
was
drawn
up
and
spain
sold
louisiana
to
france
by
october
the
ambassador
was
once
again
back
in
paris
at
his
old
post
of
minister
of
wara
post
which
he
held
continuously
during
peace
and
war
till
august
1807
the
position
was
no
light
one
for
even
during
the
short
years
of
peace
it
involved
the
supervision
of
the
expedition
to
san
domingo
the
defence
of
italy
the
reorganisation
of
the
army
and
the
rearmament
of
the
artillery
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
routine
of
official
work
moreover
the
foundations
of
the
consulate
being
based
on
the
army
it
was
essential
that
the
army
should
be
efficient
and
content
and
consequently
the
french
soldier
of
that
day
was
not
as
in
other
countries
neglected
in
peace
time
the
officers
in
command
of
the
troops
were
constantly
reminded
by
the
war
minister
that
the
french
soldier
is
a
citizen
placed
under
military
lawnot
an
outcast
or
serf
whose
wellbeing
and
comfort
concern
no
one

on
the
establishment
of
the
empire
berthier
like
many
another
received
the
reward
for
his
faithfulness
to
napoleon
honours
were
showered
upon
him
the
first
to
receive
the
marshals
bâton
he
was
in
succession
created
senator
by
right
as
a
dignitary
of
the
empire
grand
officer
of
the
palace
and
grand
huntsman
to
the
crown
while
at
the
coronation
he
carried
the
imperial
globe
but
though
the
emperor
thus
honoured
and
treated
him
as
his
most
trustworthy
confidant
the
cares
of
state
to
some
extent
withdrew
napoleon
from
close
intimacy
with
his
old
companion
at
the
same
time
the
marshal
was
insensibly
separated
from
his
former
comradesinarms
by
his
high
rank
and
employment
which
while
it
tended
to
make
him
more
the
servant
than
the
friend
of
the
emperor
also
caused
him
to
be
regarded
as
a
superior
to
be
obeyed
by
those
who
were
formerly
his
equals
at
all
times
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
one
who
never
passed
over
a
breach
of
orders
the
marshal
as
voicing
the
commands
of
the
emperor
gradually
began
to
assume
a
stern
attitude
to
all
subordinates
and
spared
neither
princes
or
marshals
when
he
considered
that
the
good
of
the
service
required
that
they
should
be
reprimanded
and
shown
their
duty
so
strong
was
the
sense
of
subordination
in
the
army
and
the
desire
to
stand
well
with
napoleon
that
even
the
fiery
murat
paid
attention
to
orders
and
reprimands
signed
by
berthier
in
the
name
of
the
emperor

meanwhile
the
work
of
the
war
minister
increased
day
by
day
the
organisation
and
supervision
of
the
army
of
the
ocean
added
considerably
to
his
work
which
was
much
interfered
with
by
visits
of
inspection
in
company
with
the
emperor
or
fardistant
expeditions
to
the
frontiers
and
to
italy
for
the
coronation
at
milan

on
august
3rd
1805
the
emperor
created
the
marshal
majorgeneral
and
chief
of
the
staff
to
the
army
of
the
ocean
and
himself
assumed
command
of
the
army
and
held
a
grand
review
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
everybody
thought
that
the
moment
for
the
invasion
of
england
had
arrived
berthier
and
perhaps
talleyrand
alone
knew
that
austria
not
england
was
the
immediate
quarry
and
all
through
august
the
majorgeneral
was
busy
working
out
the
routes
for
the
concentration
of
the
various
corps
in
the
valley
of
the
danube
whilst
at
the
same
time
as
war
minister
he
was
responsible
for
the
supervision
of
all
the
troops
left
in
france
and
in
garrison
in
italy
belgium
holland
and
hanover
consequently
he
had
to
divide
his
staff
into
two
sections
one
of
which
he
took
with
him
into
the
field
the
other
remaining
in
paris
under
an
assistant
who
was
capable
of
managing
the
ordinary
routine
but
who
had
to
forward
all
difficult
problems
to
the
war
minister
in
the
field
even
during
the
drive
to
the
frontier
there
was
no
abatement
of
the
strain
during
the
journey
the
emperor
would
give
orders
which
had
to
be
expanded
and
written
out
in
the
short
stoppages
for
food
and
rest
by
day
the
majorgeneral
travelled
in
the
emperors
carriage
at
night
he
always
slept
under
the
same
roof
with
him
to
be
ready
at
any
moment
in
full
uniform
to
receive
his
commands
and
expand
and
dictate
them
to
his
clerks
everyone
knew
when
the
majorgeneral
was
worried
for
he
had
a
habit
of
biting
his
nails
when
making
a
decision
or
trying
to
solve
a
problem
but
otherwise
he
never
showed
any
sign
of
feeling
and
whether
tired
or
troubled
by
the
emperors
occasional
outbursts
of
temper
he
went
on
with
his
work
with
the
methodical
precision
of
an
automaton
to
belong
to
the
general
staff
when
berthier
was
majorgeneral
was
no
bed
of
roses
no
place
for
gilded
youth
for
with
napoleon
commanding
and
berthier
directing
if
there
was
often
fighting
there
was
plenty
of
writing
if
there
was
galloping
on
horseback
by
day
to
make
up
for
it
by
night
there
were
hours
of
steady
copying
of
orders
and
no
chance
of
laying
down
the
pen
until
all
business
was
finished
thanks
to
this
excellent
staff
work
napoleons
ambitious
plans
were
faithfully
accomplished
the
austrians
were
completely
taken
in
by
the
demonstration
in
the
black
forest
the
french
columns
stepped
astride
of
their
communications
on
the
danube
and
mack
was
forced
to
surrender
at
ulm
but
ulm
was
only
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
and
even
after
austerlitz
napoleon
pursued
the
enemy
with
grim
resolution
this
was
one
of
the
secrets
of
his
success
for
as
berthier

the
emperors
opinion
is
that
in
war
nothing
is
really
achieved
as
long
as
there
remains
something
to
achieve
a
victory
is
not
complete
as
long
as
greater
success
can
still
be
gained

after
the
treaty
of
pressburg
on
december
27
1805
napoleon
quitted
the
army
and
returned
to
paris
leaving
the
majorgeneral
in
command
of
the
grand
army
with
orders
to
evacuate
the
conquered
territory
when
the
terms
of
the
treaty
had
been
carried
out
by
the
austrians
but
the
emperor
retained
the
real
control
and
every
day
a
courier
had
to
be
despatched
to
paris
with
a
detailed
account
of
every
event
and
every
day
a
courier
arrived
from
paris
bearing
fresh
orders
and
instructions
for
napoleon
refused
to
allow
the
slightest
deviation
from
his
orders
keep
strictly
to
the
orders
i
give
you
he
wrote
execute
punctually
your
instructions
i
alone
know
what
i
want
done
meanwhile
the
majorgeneral
was
still
war
minister
and
had
to
supervise
all
the
more
important
business
of
the
war
office
while
he
also
found
time
to
edit
an
official
history
of
the
campaign
of
1805
and
to
superintend
the
execution
of
a
map
of
most
of
the
austrian
possessions
the
work
was
immense
but
berthier
never
flagged
and
the
emperor
showed
his
appreciation
of
his
zeal
when
on
march
30th
1806
he
conferred
on
him
the
principality
of
neuchâtel
with
the
title
of
prince
and
duke
to
hold
in
full
possession
and
suzerainty
for
himself
his
heirs
and
successors
with
one
stipulation
that
he
should
marry
he
added
that
the
princes
passion
for
madame
visconti
had
lasted
too
long
that
it
was
not
becoming
to
a
dignitary
of
the
empire
and
that
he
was
now
fifty
years
old
and
ought
to
think
of
providing
an
heir
to
his
honours
the
prince
marshal
never
had
time
to
visit
personally
his
principality
but
he
sent
one
of
his
intimate
friends
general
dutaillis
to
provide
for
the
welfare
of
his
new
subjects
and
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
saw
that
they
were
well
governed
while
a
battalion
of
picked
troops
from
neuchâtel
was
added
to
the
imperial
guard
but
orders
or
no
orders
the
prince
could
never
break
himself
free
from
the
trammels
of
his
mistress
and
napoleon
gave
him
but
little
leisure
in
which
to
find
a
congenial
partner
so
that
it
was
not
till
after
tilsit
in
the
brief
pause
before
the
peninsular
war
that
berthier
at
last
took
a
wife
his
chosen
princess
was
elizabeth
the
daughter
of
william
duke
of
bavaria
brother
of
the
king
she
was
married
with
all
due
solemnity
in
march
1808
and
though
the
exigencies
of
war
gave
her
but
little
opportunity
of
seeing
much
of
her
husband
affection
existed
between
them
as
also
between
berthier
and
his
fatherinlaw
the
duke
of
bavaria
all
cause
of
difficulty
was
smoothed
over
by
the
fact
that
in
time
the
princess
herself
conceived
an
affection
for
madame
visconti

by
september
1806
the
grand
army
had
evacuated
austria
and
the
prince
marshal
was
hoping
to
return
to
paris
when
suddenly
he
was
informed
by
the
emperor
of
the
probability
of
a
campaign
against
prussia
on
the
23rd
definite
orders
arrived
indicating
the
points
of
assembly
by
the
next
day
detailed
letters
of
instructions
for
every
corps
had
been
worked
out
and
despatched
by
the
headquarters
staff
napoleon
himself
arrived
at
würzburg
on
october
2nd
and
found
his
army
concentrated
but
deficient
of
supplies
at
first
his
anger
burst
out
against
the
chief
of
the
staff
but
a
moments
reflection
proved
to
him
that
there
was
not
sufficient
transport
in
germany
to
mass
both
men
and
supplies
in
the
time
he
had
given
and
he
entirely
exonerated
berthier
who
by
hard
work
contrived
in
three
days
to
collect
sufficient
supplies
to
allow
of
the
opening
of
the
thirty
days
campaign
which
commenced
with
jena
and
ended
by
carrying
the
french
troops
across
the
vistula
the
fresh
campaign
in
the
spring
of
1807
was
attended
by
an
additional
difficulty
there
existed
no
maps
of
the
district
and
the
topographical
department
of
the
staff
was
worked
off
its
legs
in
supplying
this
deficiency
meanwhile
during
the
halt
after
pultusk
the
majorgeneral
was
busy
reclothing
and
reequipping
the
army
and
hurrying
up
reinforcements
while
in
addition
to
the
work
of
the
war
office
he
had
to
supervise
the
french
forces
in
italy
and
naples
after
tilsit
as
after
pressburg
napoleon
hurried
back
to
france
and
left
the
prince
of
neuchâtel
to
arrange
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
grand
army
and
it
was
not
till
july
27th
that
berthier
at
last
returned
to
paris

the
prince
came
back
more
than
ever
dazzled
by
the
genius
of
the
emperor
not
even
eylau
had
taught
him
that
there
were
limits
to
his
idols
powers
but
with
more
than
eight
hundred
thousand
men
on
a
war
footing
with
divisions
and
army
corps
scattered
from
the
atlantic
to
the
niemen
from
lübeck
to
brindisi
it
was
impossible
for
one
man
to
be
at
once
chief
of
the
staff
and
minister
of
war
accordingly
on
august
9th
the
emperor
made
general
clarke
minister
of
war
and
to
show
that
this
was
no
slight
on
his
old
friend
on
the
same
day
he
created
the
prince
of
neuchâtel
viceconstable
of
france
for
the
next
three
months
berthier
was
able
to
enjoy
his
honours
at
his
home
at
grosbois
or
in
his
honorary
capacity
at
fontainebleau
but
in
november
the
emperor
carried
him
off
with
him
to
italy
on
a
tour
of
inspection
during
the
whole
of
this
holiday
in
italy
the
prince
was
busy
elaborating
the
details
of
the
coming
campaign
in
spain
and
it
was
the
spanish
trouble
which
cut
short
his
honeymoon
for
on
april
2nd
he
had
to
start
with
the
emperor
for
bayonne
from
the
outset
the
prince
warned
the
emperor
that
the
question
of
supplies
lay
at
the
root
of
all
difficulties
in
spain
but
napoleon
clung
to
his
idea
that
war
should
support
war
and
berthier
knew
that
it
was
hopeless
to
attempt
to
remove
a
fixed
idea
from
his
head
and
still
believing
in
his
omnipotence
he
thought
all
would
be
well
meanwhile
as
the
summer
went
on
it
was
not
only
spain
that
occupied
the
princes
attention
for
the
conquest
of
denmark
had
to
be
arranged
and
the
passes
in
silesia
and
bohemia
carefully
mapped
in
view
of
hostilities
with
prussia
or
austria
early
in
august
berthier
was
at
saint
cloud
making
arrangements
to
reinforce
davout
in
silesia
owing
to
the
growing
hostility
of
austria
when
on
the
16th
arrived
the
news
that
joseph
had
had
to
evacuate
all
the
country
west
of
the
ebro
but
napoleon
and
berthier
could
not
go
to
his
help
until
after
the
imperial
meeting
at
erfurt
in
september
however
on
reaching
spain
the
magic
of
the
emperors
personality
soon
restored
the
vigour
and
prestige
of
the
french
arms
still
the
prince
marshal
could
not
hide
from
himself
that
all
was
not
as
it
used
to
be
napoleons
temper
was
more
uncertain
and
the
marshals
smarting
under
reprimands
were
not
pulling
together
when
the
emperor
returned
to
france
after
having
missed
the
opportunity
of
giving
the
english
a
good
lesson
he
left
berthier
behind
for
a
fortnight
to
be
sure
that
king
joseph
had
a
proper
understanding
of
everything
but
trouble
was
bound
to
come
for
the
emperor
himself
was
breaking
his
own
canon
of
the
importance
of
the
unity
of
command
by
nominally
leaving
joseph
in
control
of
all
the
troops
in
spain
but
at
the
same
time
making
the
marshals
responsible
to
himself
through
the
majorgeneral

in
1809
napoleon
made
another
grave
mistake
he
had
calculated
that
austria
could
make
no
forward
movement
before
april
15th
and
accordingly
he
sent
berthier
early
in
march
to
take
temporary
command
of
the
grand
army
with
instructions
to
order
davout
to
concentrate
at
ratisbon
and
masséna
at
augsburg
his
idea
was
that
there
would
be
ample
time
later
to
order
a
concentration
on
either
wing
or
on
the
centre
but
the
austrians
were
ready
quite
a
fortnight
before
he
had
calculated
the
majorgeneral
kept
him
well
informed
of
every
movement
of
the
enemy
and
pointed
out
the
dangerous
isolation
of
davout
still
the
emperor
did
not
believe
the
austrian
preparations
were
so
forward
and
a
despatch
from
paris
written
on
april
10th
which
arrived
at
headquarters
at
donauwörth
on
the
11th
ordered
the
majorgeneral
to
retain
davout
at
ratisbon
and
move
his
own
headquarters
there
and
that
in
spite
of
anything
that
may
happen
unfortunately
a
semaphore
despatch
sent
a
few
hours
later
when
napoleon
had
really
grasped
the
situation
went
astray
and
never
reached
berthier
the
prince
of
neuchâtel
understood
as
clearly
as
any
one
the
dangerous
position
of
davout
the
duke
of
eckmühl
himself
thought
that
the
majorgeneral
was
trying
to
spoil
his
career
by
laying
him
open
to
certain
defeat
depression
spread
through
all
the
french
corps
but
after
years
of
blind
devotion
to
his
great
chief
berthier
could
not
steel
himself
to
break
distinct
orders
emphasised
as
they
were
by
the
expression
in
spite
of
whatever
may
happen
and
a
great
catastrophe
was
only
just
averted
by
the
arrival
of
napoleon
who
at
once
ordered
davout
to
withdraw
and
masséna
to
advance
berthier
himself
was
visited
by
the
full
fury
of
the
emperors
anger
but
the
cloud
soon
passed
for
berthier
was
as
indispensable
as
ever
and
more
so
when
after
the
failure
at
aspernessling
immense
efforts
had
to
be
made
to
hurry
up
troops
from
every
available
source
at
the
end
of
the
campaign
the
emperor
justly
rewarded
his
lieutenant
by
creating
him
prince
of
wagram

once
again
napoleon
left
berthier
to
arrange
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
army
and
it
was
not
till
december
1st
that
the
prince
of
wagram
regained
paris
and
took
up
the
threads
of
the
peninsular
campaign
his
stay
there
was
short
for
by
the
end
of
february
he
was
back
again
in
vienna
this
time
not
as
majorgeneral
of
a
victorious
army
but
as
ambassador
extraordinary
to
claim
the
hand
of
the
archduchess
marie
louise
for
his
master
the
emperor
napoleon
and
to
escort
her
to
her
new
home
for
the
next
two
years
the
prince
remained
at
home
at
grosbois
or
on
duty
at
fontainebleau
but
in
spite
of
great
domestic
happiness
he
was
much
worried
by
the
terrible
spanish
war
no
one
saw
more
clearly
that
every
effort
ought
to
be
made
to
crush
the
english
but
he
was
powerless
to
persuade
the
emperor
and
he
had
to
endure
to
the
full
all
the
difficulties
arising
from
breaking
the
unity
of
command
no
one
understood
better
what
hopeless
difficulties
would
arise
when
napoleon
ordered
him
to
write
the
king
will
command
the
army
the
guard
does
not
form
part
of
the
army
to
add
to
these
troubles
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
germany
was
riddled
with
secret
societies
and
that
war
with
russia
was
inevitable
so
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
in
january
1812
he
received
the
order
to
turn
his
attention
from
spain
and
resume
his
functions
as
majorgeneral
of
the
grand
army
not
that
he
desired
further
active
service
like
many
another
of
the
emperors
soldiers
he
mistrusted
the
distant
expedition
to
russia
and
feared
for
the
honour
and
safety
of
france
already
in
his
sixtieth
year
there
was
little
he
could
gain
personally
from
war
as
he
said
to
napoleon
what
is
the
good
of
having
given
me
an
income
of
sixty
thousand
pounds
a
year
in
order
to
inflict
on
me
the
tortures
of
tantalus
i
shall
die
here
with
all
this
work
the
simplest
private
is
happier
than
i
the
emperor
knowing
the
attitude
of
many
of
his
marshals
and
himself
feeling
the
strain
of
this
immense
enterprise
was
unusually
irritable
consequently
relations
at
headquarters
were
often
strained
and
the
marshals
were
angry
at
the
severe
reprimands
to
which
they
were
subjected
the
controlling
leaders
being
out
of
gear
the
machine
did
not
run
smoothly
there
was
nothing
but
friction
and
tension
the
marshals
were
inclined
to
attribute
their
disgrace
to
the
illwill
of
berthier
and
not
to
the
temper
of
napoleon
particularly
was
this
the
case
with
davout
who
since
1809
had
suspected
that
berthier
desired
to
ruin
his
reputation
accordingly
the
prince
of
eckmühl
set
down
the
succession
of
reprimands
which
were
hurled
at
his
head
to
the
machinations
of
the
majorgeneral
and
not
as
was
the
case
to
napoleons
jealousy
of
him
because
people
had
prophesied
he
would
become
king
of
poland
this
misunderstanding
was
most
unfortunate
for
it
prevented
berthier
from
effecting
a
reconciliation
between
davout
and
the
emperor
hence
napoleon
was
driven
more
and
more
to
trust
to
the
advice
of
the
rash
unstable
king
of
naples
the
majorgenerals
lot
through
the
campaign
was
most
miserable
working
day
and
night
to
supervise
the
organisation
of
the
huge
force
of
six
hundred
thousand
men
mistrusted
by
his
former
comrades
blamed
for
every
mishap
by
the
emperor
whatever
the
fault
might
be
he
had
to
put
up
with
the
bitterest
insults
and
while
working
as
no
other
man
could
work
to
endure
such
taunts
as
not
only
are
you
no
good
but
you
are
in
the
way
everything
that
went
wrong
was
the
fault
of
the
general
staff
which
is
so
organised
that
it
foresees
nothing
whether
it
was
the
shortcomings
of
the
contractors
or
the
burning
of
their
own
magazines
by
the
russians
but
what
most
moved
napoleons
anger
against
the
chief
of
the
staff
was
that
berthier
with
the
parade
states
before
him
emphasising
the
enormous
wastage
of
the
army
constantly
harped
on
the
danger
of
pressing
on
to
moscow
so
strained
became
the
relations
between
them
that
for
the
last
part
of
the
advance
they
no
longer
met
at
meals
but
during
the
hours
of
the
retreat
the
old
friendship
was
resumed
berthier
bore
no
malice
and
showed
his
bravery
by
himself
opposing
the
enemy
with
musket
and
bayonet
and
on
one
occasion
with
bessières
murat
and
rapp
he
saved
the
emperor
from
a
sotnia
of
cossacks

when
napoleon
quitted
the
army
at
vilna
he
left
the
majorgeneral
behind
to
help
the
king
of
naples
to
withdraw
the
remnant
of
the
grand
army
marching
on
foot
through
the
deep
snow
with
fingers
and
nose
frostbitten
the
sturdy
old
veteran
of
sixty
endured
the
fatigue
as
well
as
the
hardiest
young
men
in
their
prime
and
in
addition
to
the
physical
fatigue
of
marching
had
to
carry
out
all
the
administrative
work
and
bear
the
moral
responsibility
for
what
remained
of
the
army
for
the
king
of
naples
thinking
of
nothing
but
how
to
save
his
own
crown
when
difficulties
increased
followed
the
example
of
napoleon
and
deserted
his
post
thereon
the
majorgeneral
took
on
himself
to
nominate
prince
eugène
as
murats
successor
but
in
the
end
his
health
gave
way
and
the
emperor
himself
wrote
to
prince
eugène
telling
him
to
send
the
old
warrior
home

berthier
reached
paris
on
february
9th
much
broken
down
in
health
but
his
wonderful
physique
soon
enabled
him
to
regain
his
strength
and
by
the
end
of
march
he
was
once
again
hard
at
work
helping
the
emperor
to
extemporise
an
army
with
his
complete
knowledge
of
this
force
no
one
was
more
astonished
than
berthier
at
the
successes
of
lützen
and
bautzen
and
no
one
more
insistent
in
his
advice
to
the
emperor
to
accept
the
terms
of
the
allies
during
the
armistice
but
he
advised
in
vain
then
followed
the
terrible
catastrophe
of
leipzig
due
undoubtedly
to
berthiers
dread
of
acting
without
the
express
orders
of
the
emperor
the
engineer
officer
charged
with
preparing
the
line
of
retreat
reported
that
the
one
bridge
across
the
elster
was
not
sufficient
the
majorgeneral
knowing
that
the
emperor
desired
to
hide
any
signs
of
retreat
from
the
allies
replied
that
he
must
await
the
emperors
orders
so
when
after
three
days
fighting
the
retreat
could
no
longer
be
postponed
a
catastrophe
was
inevitable

yet
in
spite
of
everything
the
emperor
refused
to
acknowledge
himself
beaten
and
by
the
commencement
of
1814
was
once
again
ready
to
take
the
field
though
by
now
the
allies
had
invaded
france
loyal
as
ever
berthier
worked
his
hardest
but
he
once
again
incurred
the
emperors
anger
by
entreating
him
to
accept
the
terms
offered
him
at
châtillon
still
when
the
end
came
and
napoleon
abdicated
berthier
remained
at
his
side
and
it
was
only
when
the
emperor
had
released
his
marshals
from
their
allegiance
that
on
april
11th
he
sent
in
his
adhesion
to
the
new
government
when
all
save
macdonald
had
deserted
the
fallen
emperor
berthier
stayed
on
at
fontainebleau
directing
the
withdrawal
of
the
remnants
of
the
army
and
making
arrangements
for
the
guard
which
was
to
accompany
napoleon
to
elba
but
though
he
remained
with
him
until
the
day
before
he
started
for
elba
berthier
refused
to
share
his
exile
and
at
the
time
napoleon
was
magnanimous
enough
to
see
that
owing
to
his
age
and
the
care
of
his
children
he
could
not
expect
such
a
sacrifice

so
far
the
prince
had
done
all
that
honour
and
affection
could
demand
of
him
but
unfortunately
for
his
fame
instead
of
withdrawing
into
private
life
he
listened
to
the
prayers
of
his
wife
who
keenly
felt
the
loss
of
her
title
of
serene
princess
it
was
at
her
desire
that
he
continued
to
frequent
the
bourbon
court
and
actually
accepted
the
captaincy
of
one
of
the
new
companies
of
royal
guards
this
and
the
fact
that
as
senior
of
the
marshals
berthier
had
led
his
fellow
marshals
to
meet
the
king
at
compiègne
caused
the
prince
of
wagram
to
be
regarded
as
a
traitor
by
napoleon
and
the
imperialists
moreover
the
prince
marshal
now
saw
in
napoleon
the
disturber
of
the
peace
of
europe
so
when
the
emperor
suddenly
returned
from
elba
he
withdrew
from
france
and
retired
to
bamberg
in
his
fatherinlaws
dominions

it
is
commonly
supposed
that
berthier
committed
suicide
but
the
medical
evidence
shows
that
his
fall
was
probably
the
result
of
giddiness
arising
from
dyspepsia
it
was
on
june
1st
that
the
accident
happened
he
was
watching
a
division
of
russian
troops
passing
through
the
town
and
was
much
distressed
by
the
sight
and
heard
to
murmur
my
poor
country
ever
interested
in
soldiers
he
got
on
a
chair
on
the
balcony
before
the
nursery
windows
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
troops
and
while
doing
so
lost
his
balance
and
fell
to
the
ground

for
the
moment
the
tragic
death
of
the
marshal
was
the
talk
of
europe
but
only
for
the
moment
for
the
fate
of
the
world
was
hanging
on
the
issues
of
the
great
battle
which
was
imminent
in
belgium
if
the
prince
of
wagram
had
been
there
it
is
more
than
conceivable
that
the
scales
would
have
fallen
other
than
they
did
for
it
was
the
indifferent
staff
work
of
soult
and
the
bad
drafting
of
orders
which
lost
the
french
the
campaign
of
this
napoleon
was
so
firmly
convinced
that
he
never
could
efface
it
from
his
memory
again
and
again
he
was
heard
saying
if
berthier
had
been
here
i
should
never
have
met
this
misfortune
the
emperor
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
1814
he
had
told
macdonald
that
berthier
could
never
return
was
convinced
that
he
would
and
had
told
rapp
that
he
was
certain
he
would
come
back
to
him
it
was
this
failure
to
return
which
so
embittered
the
fallen
emperor
against
the
prince
of
wagram
and
led
to
those
cruel
strictures
on
his
character
to
which
he
gave
vent
at
st
helena
moreover
napoleon
so
great
in
many
things
was
so
jealous
of
his
own
glory
that
he
could
be
mean
beyond
words
even
in
the
early
years
when
he
heard
people
praising
berthiers
work
in
1796
he
told
his
secretary
bourrienne
as
for
berthier
since
you
have
been
with
me
you
see
what
he
ishe
is
a
blockhead
at
st
helena
forgetting
his
old
opinions
berthier
has
his
talents
activity
courage
characterall
in
his
favour
forgetting
that
he
himself
had
taught
berthier
to
be
imperious
he
derided
his
rather
pompous
manner
saying
nothing
is
so
imperious
as
weakness
which
feels
itself
supported
by
strength
look
at
women
berthier
with
his
admirably
lucid
mind
great
physique
methodical
powers
and
ambition
would
have
made
his
name
in
any
profession
he
undoubtedly
chose
to
be
second
to
napoleon
he
served
him
with
a
fidelity
that
napoleon
himself
could
not
understand
and
he
won
his
great
commanders
love
and
esteem
in
spite
of
the
selfishness
of
the
corsicans
nature
i
really
cannot
understand
said
napoleon
to
talleyrand
how
a
relation
that
has
the
appearance
of
friendship
has
established
itself
between
berthier
and
me
i
do
not
indulge
in
useless
sentiments
and
berthier
is
so
uninteresting
that
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
care
about
him
at
all
and
yet
when
i
think
of
it
i
really
have
some
liking
for
him
it
is
because
he
believes
in
you
said
the
former
bishop
and
reader
of
mens
souls
it
was
this
belief
in
napoleon
which
in
time
obsessed
the
prince
of
wagrams
mind
which
killed
his
own
initiative
and
was
responsible
for
his
blunders
in
1809
and
at
leipzig
and
turned
him
into
a
machine
which
merely
echoed
the
emperors
commands
monsieur
le
maréchal
the
emperor
orders
monsieur
it
is
not
me
it
is
the
emperor
you
ought
to
thank
these
hackneyed
phrases
typified
more
than
anything
else
the
bounds
of
the
career
which
the
marshal
had
deliberately
marked
out
for
himself
in
berthiers
eyes
it
was
no
reproach
but
a
testimony
to
his
own
principles
that
he
never
gave
an
order
never
wrote
a
despatch
which
did
not
in
some
way
emanate
from
napoleon
it
was
this
which
with
some
appearance
of
truth
pointing
to
his
notable
failures
allowed
napoleon
to
say
of
him
at
st
helena
his
character
was
undecided
not
strong
enough
for
a
commanderinchief
but
he
possessed
all
the
qualities
of
a
good
chief
of
the
staff
a
complete
mastery
of
the
map
great
skill
in
reconnaissance
minute
care
in
the
despatch
of
orders
magnificent
aptitude
for
presenting
with
the
greatest
simplicity
the
most
complicated
situation
of
an
army

joachim
murat
marshal
king
of
naples


stableboy
seminarist
marshal
king
murat
holds
the
unchallenged
position
of
prince
of
gascons
petulant
persevering
ambitious
and
vain
he
surpasses
dartagnan
himself
in
his
overwhelming
conceit
the
third
son
of
an
innkeeper
of
la
bastide
fortunière
in
upper
quercy
joachim
murat
was
born
on
march
25
1767
from
his
earliest
childhood
joachim
was
a
horselover
and
a
frequenter
of
the
stables
but
his
parents
had
higher
aims
for
their
bright
smiling
intelligent
darling
and
destined
him
for
the
priesthood
the
young
seminarist
was
highly
thought
of
by
the
preceptors
at
the
college
of
saint
michel
at
cahors
and
the
lazarist
fathers
at
toulouse
but
neither
priest
nor
mother
had
truly
grasped
his
dashing
character
and
one
february
morning
in
1787
joachim
slipped
quietly
out
of
the
seminary
doors
and
enlisted
in
the
chasseurs
of
the
ardennes
who
were
at
the
moment
billeted
in
toulouse
two
years
later
this
promising
recruit
having
fallen
foul
of
the
military
authorities
had
to
leave
the
service
under
a
cloud
a
post
as
drapers
assistant
was
a
poor
exchange
for
the
young
soldier
who
found
the
cavalry
service
of
the
royal
army
scarcely
dashing
enough
but
the
revolution
gave
an
outlet
which
murat
was
quick
to
seize
for
three
years
the
future
king
harangued
village
audiences
of
quercy
on
the
iniquities
of
caste
and
the
equality
of
all
men
so
that
when
in
february
1792
the
assembly
called
for
volunteers
for
the
garde
constitutionnelle
of
louis
xvi
what
better
choice
could
the
national
guard
of
montfaucon
make
than
in
nominating
joachim
murat
the
handsome
exsergeant
of
the
chasseurs
of
the
ardennes

in
paris
joachim
soon
found
that
the
royal
road
to
success
lay
in
denouncing
loudly
all
superior
officers
of
lack
of
patriotism
soon
there
was
no
more
brazenvoiced
accuser
than
murat
in
the
course
of
a
year
he
worked
his
way
out
of
the
garde
constitutionnelle
and
by
april
1793
he
had
attained
the
rank
of
captain
in
the
12th
chasseurs
meanwhile
he
had
been
selected
as
aidedecamp
by
general
dure
de
molans
having
seen
no
service
he
owed
his
appointment
largely
to
his
conceit
and
good
looks
blueeyed
with
an
aquiline
nose
and
smiling
lips
with
long
chestnut
curls
falling
over
his
wellpoised
head
endowed
with
great
physical
strength
shown
in
his
strong
supple
arms
and
in
the
long
flatthighed
legs
of
a
horseman
he
appeared
the
most
perfect
type
of
the
daredevil
dashing
cavalry
soldier
the
moderate
republican
general
dure
de
molans
was
useful
to
him
for
a
time
but
the
young
gascon
saw
that
the
days
of
the
extremist
were
close
at
hand
accordingly
he
allied
himself
with
an
adventurer
called
landrieux
who
was
raising
a
body
of
cutthroats
whose
object
was
plunder
not
fighting
the
convention
which
had
licensed
landrieux
to
raise
this
corps
of
patriotic
defenders
of
the
country
accepted
his
nomination
of
murat
as
acting
lieutenantcolonel
but
they
soon
fell
out
for
murat
had
the
audacity
to
try
and
make
these
patriots
fight
instead
of
merely
seeking
plunder
the
consequence
of
this
quarrel
was
that
early
in
1794
he
found
himself
accused
as
a
cidevant
noble
imprisoned
at
amiens
and
brought
before
the
committee
of
public
safety
in
a
fit
of
republican
enthusiasm
he
changed
his
name
to
marat
but
this
did
not
save
him
and
he
owed
his
life
to
a
deputation
from
his
native
quercy
which
proved
both
his
humble
birth
and
his
high
republicanism

from

at

the
13th
vendémiaire
was
the
turningpoint
in
murats
life
for
on
that
day
for
the
first
time
he
came
in
contact
with
his
future
chief
the
young
general
bonaparte
and
gained
his
attention
by
the
masterly
way
he
saved
the
guns
at
sablons
from
the
hands
of
the
royalists
the
future
emperor
ever
knew
when
to
reward
merit
and
on
being
appointed
to
command
the
army
in
italy
he
at
once
selected
him
as
his
aidedecamp
so
far
he
had
seen
little
or
no
war
service
but
the
campaign
of
1796
proved
that
bonapartes
judgment
was
sound
for
by
the
end
of
the
year
there
was
no
longer
any
necessity
for
murat
to
blow
his
own
trumpet
in
the
short
campaign
against
the
sardinians
he
showed
his
talent
as
a
cavalry
leader
by
his
judgment
in
charges
at
dego
and
mondovi
he
had
no
cause
to
grumble
that
he
was
not
appreciated
for
his
general
selected
him
to
take
to
paris
the
news
of
this
victorious
campaign
and
of
the
triumphant
negotiations
of
cherasco
he
returned
from
paris
in
may
as
brigadiergeneral
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
crossing
of
the
mincio
and
to
rob
kilmaine
of
some
of
his
honours
the
commanderinchief
still
kept
him
attached
to
the
headquarter
staff
and
constantly
employed
him
on
special
service
his
enterprises
were
numerous
and
variedone
week
at
genoa
on
a
special
diplomatic
mission
a
week
or
two
later
leading
a
forlorn
attack
on
the
great
fortress
of
mantua
then
commanding
the
right
wing
of
the
army
covering
the
siege
he
showed
himself
ever
resourceful
and
daring
but
during
the
autumn
of
1796
he
fell
under
the
heavy
displeasure
of
his
chief
for
at
milan
and
montebello
josephine
had
shown
too
great
favour
to
the
young
cavalry
general
murat
accordingly
had
no
scruples
in
intriguing
with
barras
against
his
chief
but
his
glorious
conduct
at
rivoli
once
again
brought
him
back
to
favour
and
bonaparte
entrusted
him
with
an
infantry
brigade
in
the
advance
on
vienna
and
later
with
a
delicate
independent
mission
in
the
valtelline
but
murat
unlike
lannes
marmont
and
duroc
was
not
yet
indispensable
to
bonaparte
and
accordingly
was
left
with
the
army
of
italy
when
the
general
returned
in
triumph
to
paris
it
was
mainly
owing
to
massénas
enthusiastic
report
of
his
service
in
the
roman
campaign
at
the
close
of
1797
that
he
was
selected
as
one
of
the
supernumerary
officers
in
the
egyptian
expedition

so
far
murat
had
not
yet
been
able
to
distinguish
himself
above
his
comradesinarms
masséna
augereau
serurier
and
laharpe
left
him
far
in
the
rear
but
egypt
was
to
give
him
the
chance
of
proving
his
worth
and
showing
that
he
was
not
only
a
dashing
officer
but
a
cavalry
commander
of
the
first
rank
he
led
the
cavalry
of
the
advance
guard
in
the
march
up
the
nile
and
was
present
at
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
and
the
taking
of
cairo
but
so
far
the
campaign
instead
of
bringing
him
fresh
honours
nearly
brought
him
disgrace
for
he
joined
the
party
of
grumblers
and
was
one
of
those
who
were
addressed
in
the
famous
reprimand
i
know
some
generals
are
mutinous
and
preach
revolt

let
them
take
care
i
am
as
high
above
a
general
as
above
a
drummer
and
if
necessary
i
will
as
soon
have
the
one
shot
as
the
other

on
july
27
1798
murat
was
appointed
governor
of
the
province
of
kalioub
which
lies
north
of
cairo
to
keep
order
among
his
turbulent
subjects
his
whole
force
consisted
of
a
battalion
of
infantry
twentyfive
cavalrymen
and
a
threepounder
gun
his
governorship
was
only
part
of
the
work
bonaparte
required
of
him
for
he
was
constantly
away
organising
and
leading
light
columns
by
land
or
river
harrying
the
arabs
and
disbanded
mamelukes
sweeping
the
country
collecting
vast
depôts
of
corn
and
cattle
remounting
the
cavalryproving
himself
a
past
master
in
irregular
warfare
so
well
did
he
do
his
work
that
the
commanderinchief
selected
him
to
command
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
in
the
syrian
expeditionary
force
thanks
to
his
handling
of
his
horsemen
the
march
through
palestine
occasioned
the
french
but
little
loss
during
the
siege
of
acre
he
commanded
the
covering
force
and
pushed
reconnaissances
far
and
wide
so
feared
was
his
name
that
the
whole
turkish
army
fled
before
him
on
the
banks
of
the
jordan
and
left
their
camp
and
immense
booty
in
the
hands
of
the
french
but
though
he
had
thus
destroyed
the
relieving
force
acre
victualled
by
the
english
fleet
still
held
out
and
bonaparte
had
to
retreat
to
egypt

it
was
at
aboukir
that
murat
consolidated
his
reputation
as
a
great
commander
the
turkish
general
had
neglected
to
rest
the
right
flank
of
his
first
line
on
the
sea
and
murat
seizing
his
opportunity
fell
on
the
unguarded
flank
with
the
full
weight
of
his
cavalry
and
rolled
the
unfortunate
turks
into
the
water
thereafter
by
the
aid
of
a
battery
of
artillery
the
centre
of
the
second
line
of
the
turkish
army
was
broken
and
the
french
horse
dashing
into
the
gap
once
again
made
short
work
of
the
enemy
and
their
leader
captured
with
his
own
hands
the
turkish
commander
bonaparte
in
his
despatch
did
full
justice
to
his
subordinate
the
victory
is
mainly
due
to
general
murat
i
ask
you
to
make
him
general
of
division
his
brigade
of
cavalry
has
achieved
the
impossible
murat
himself
was
much
distressed
at
being
wounded
in
the
face
as
he
feared
it
might
destroy
his
good
looks
however
he
soon
had
the
satisfaction
of
writing
to
his
father
the
doctors
tell
me
i
shall
not
be
in
the
least
disfigured
so
tell
all
the
young
ladies
that
even
if
murat
has
lost
some
of
his
good
looks
they
wont
find
that
he
has
lost
any
of
his
bravery
in
the
war
of
love

his
grumbles
forgiven
murat
left
egypt
among
the
chosen
band
of
followers
of
whose
fidelity
napoleon
was
assured
his
special
mission
was
to
gain
over
the
cavalry
to
the
side
of
his
chief
he
it
was
who
with
leclerc
on
the
18th
brumaire
forced
his
way
into
the
orangerie
at
the
head
of
the
grenadiers
and
hurled
out
the
deputies
the
first
consul
rewarded
him
amply
appointing
him
inspector
of
the
consular
guard
and
later
still
in
preference
to
his
rival
lannes
gave
him
in
marriage
his
sister
caroline
murat
had
met
caroline
bonaparte
at
montebello
during
the
italian
campaign
of
1796
and
had
at
once
been
struck
by
her
beauty
like
many
another
cavalier
he
had
a
flame
in
every
country
or
rather
in
every
town
which
he
visited
but
by
1799
the
gay
gascon
saw
that
it
was
time
to
finish
sowing
his
wild
oats
since
destiny
was
offering
him
a
chance
which
falls
to
the
lot
of
few
mortals
it
was
by
now
clear
that
the
first
consuls
star
was
in
the
ascendant
already
his
family
were
reaping
the
fruits
of
his
success
ambition
pride
and
love
were
the
cords
of
the
net
which
drew
the
willing
murat
to
caroline
as
brotherinlaw
to
the
first
consul
joachim
felt
secure
against
his
bitter
rival
lannes
to
add
point
to
this
success
he
knew
that
the
victor
of
montebello
was
straining
every
nerve
to
gain
this
very
prize
moreover
fortune
herself
favoured
his
suit
bonaparte
had
offered
the
hand
of
caroline
to
the
great
general
moreau
but
the
future
victor
of
hohenlinden
refused
to
join
himself
to
the
corsican
triumph
to
cover
his
confusion
the
first
consul
was
glad
to
give
his
sisters
hand
to
one
of
his
most
gallant
officers
especially
as
by
so
doing
he
once
and
for
all
removed
the
haunting
fear
of
an
intrigue
between
him
and
josephine
accordingly
on
january
25
1800
murat
and
caroline
were
pronounced
man
and
wife
in
the
temple
of
the
canton
of
plailly
by
the
president
of
the
canton
though
caroline
only
brought
with
her
a
dot
of
forty
thousand
francs
she
stood
for
what
was
better
still
immense
possibilities

murats
honeymoon
was
cut
short
by
the
marengo
campaign
in
april
he
started
as
lieutenantgeneral
in
command
of
the
cavalry
to
join
the
army
of
the
reserve
at
dijon
once
the
corps
of
lannes
had
by
the
capture
of
ivrea
secured
the
opening
into
italy
the
cavalry
were
able
to
take
up
their
rôle
and
with
irresistible
weight
they
swept
down
the
plains
of
lombardy
forced
the
river
crossings
and
on
june
2nd
entered
milan
thence
the
first
consul
despatched
his
horsemen
to
seize
piacenza
the
important
bridge
across
the
po
the
key
of
the
austrian
lines
of
communication
murat
with
a
few
troops
crossed
the
river
in
some
twenty
small
rowingboats
and
dashing
forward
captured
the
bridge
head
on
the
southern
bank
and
thus
secured
not
only
the
peaceful
crossing
of
his
force
but
the
capture
of
the
town
and
the
immense
austrian
depôts
at
marengo
the
cavalry
acted
in
separate
brigades
and
the
decisive
stroke
of
the
battle
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
younger
kellermann
whose
brilliant
charge
decided
the
day
in
favour
of
the
french
the
despatches
only
mentioned
that
general
murats
clothes
were
riddled
by
bullets

so
far
murat
had
always
held
subordinate
commands
his
great
ambition
was
to
become
the
commanderinchief
of
an
independent
army
his
wife
caroline
and
his
sisterinlaw
josephine
were
constant
in
their
endeavours
to
gain
this
distinction
for
him
from
the
first
consul
but
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
1800
that
they
succeeded
and
then
only
partially
for
in
december
the
lieutenantgeneral
was
appointed
commander
of
a
corps
of
observation
whose
headquarters
were
at
milan
and
whose
duty
was
to
overawe
tuscany
and
the
papal
states
his
campaign
in
central
italy
is
more
noticeable
for
his
endeavours
to
shake
himself
free
from
the
control
of
general
brune
the
commanderinchief
of
the
army
of
italy
than
for
any
very
brilliant
manoeuvres
tuscany
and
the
papal
states
were
easily
conquered
and
the
king
of
naples
was
only
too
glad
to
buy
peace
at
foligno
italy
lay
at
the
feet
of
the
french
general
but
what
was
most
gratifying
of
all
after
his
successful
negotiation
with
the
king
of
naples
the
first
consul
tacitly
accepted
the
title
which
his
brotherinlaw
had
assumed
of
commanderinchief
of
the
army
of
naples
murat
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
under
his
orders
lieutenantgeneral
soult
three
generals
of
division
and
four
generals
of
brigade
for
the
moment
his
gascon
vanity
was
satiated
while
his
gascon
greed
was
appeased
by
substantial
bribes
from
all
the
conquered
countries
of
the
peninsula
the
commanderinchief
was
joined
at
florence
in
may
1801
by
his
wife
caroline
and
his
young
son
achille
born
in
january
whom
he
found
charming
already
possessed
of
two
teeth
in
the
capital
of
tuscany
murat
gravely
delivered
to
the
inhabitants
a
historical
lecture
on
their
science
their
civilisation
and
the
splendour
of
their
state
under
the
medici
he
spent
the
summer
in
visiting
the
wateringplaces
of
italy
in
august
the
first
consul
raised
him
to
the
command
of
the
troops
of
the
cisalpine
republic
and
he
retained
this
post
for
the
next
two
years
and
had
his
headquarters
in
milan
making
occasional
expeditions
to
paris
and
rome
and
on
the
whole
content
with
his
position
save
for
occasional
quarrels
with
melzi
the
president
of
the
italian
republic
their
jurisdictions
overlapped
and
the
gascon
would
play
second
fiddle
to
no
one
save
to
his
great
brotherinlaw

in
january
1804
the
first
consul
recalled
murat
to
paris
nominating
him
commandant
of
the
troops
of
the
first
military
division
and
of
the
national
guard
and
governor
of
the
city
bonapartes
object
was
not
so
much
to
please
his
brotherinlaw
as
to
strengthen
himself
he
was
concentrating
his
own
family
clan
and
all
his
most
faithful
followers
in
readiness
for
the
great
event
the
proclamation
of
the
empire
men
like
lannes
whose
views
were
republican
were
discreetly
kept
out
of
the
way
on
foreign
missions
but
murat
as
bonaparte
knew
was
a
pliant
tool
as
early
as
1802
he
had
hotly
favoured
the
concordat
and
had
had
his
marriage
recelebrated
by
cardinal
consalvi
and
both
caroline
and
joachim
infinitely
preferred
being
members
of
the
imperial
family
of
the
emperor
of
the
french
to
being
merely
relations
of
the
successful
general
and
first
consul
of
the
french
republic
they
were
willing
also
to
obey
the
future
emperors
commands
and
to
aid
him
socially
by
entertaining
on
a
lavish
scale
and
their
residence
in
paris
the
hotel
thélusson
became
the
centre
of
gorgeous
entertainments
while
murat
strutted
about
in
skyblue
overalls
covered
with
gold
spangles
invented
new
uniforms
and
bought
expensive
aigrettes
for
his
busby
his
wife
showed
her
rococo
taste
by
furnishing
her
drawingroom
in
red
satin
and
gold
and
her
bedroom
in
rosecoloured
satin
and
old
point
lace
they
had
their
reward
five
days
after
the
proclamation
of
the
empire
after
a
furious
scene
napoleon
conceded
the
title
of
imperial
highness
to
his
sister
with
the
bitter
words
to
listen
to
you
people
would
think
that
i
had
robbed
you
of
the
heritage
of
the
late
king
our
father
meanwhile
the
governor
of
paris
had
received
his
marshals
bâton
and
in
the
following
february
was
created
senator
prince
and
grand
admiral
of
france

the
rupture
of
the
peace
of
amiens
did
not
affect
the
life
of
the
governor
of
paris
for
two
years
he
enjoyed
this
office
with
all
its
opportunities
of
ostentation
and
display
but
in
august
1805
the
approaching
war
with
austria
caused
the
emperor
to
summon
his
most
brilliant
cavalry
leader
to
his
side
in
that
month
he
despatched
him
travelling
incognito
as
colonel
beaumont
to
survey
the
military
roads
into
germany
and
especially
to
study
the
converging
roads
round
würzburg
and
the
suitability
of
that
town
as
an
advance
depôt
for
an
army
operating
on
the
danube
from
würzburg
murat
travelled
hurriedly
through
nuremberg
ratisbon
and
passau
as
far
as
the
river
inn
returning
viâ
munich
ulm
the
black
forest
and
strassburg
immediately
on
his
return
the
emperor
appointed
him
lieutenant
of
the
empire
and
commandant
in
his
absence
of
all
the
troops
cantonned
along
the
rhine
and
of
such
corps
of
the
grand
army
as
reached
that
river
before
himself
when
war
actually
broke
out
murats
duty
was
to
mask
with
his
cavalry
in
the
black
forest
the
turning
movement
of
the
other
corps
of
the
grand
army
which
were
striking
at
the
austrian
rear
once
the
turning
movement
was
completed
the
prince
was
entrusted
with
the
command
of
the
left
wing
of
the
army
which
included
his
own
cavalry
division
and
the
corps
of
lannes
and
ney
excellent
as
he
was
as
cavalry
commander
in
the
field
murat
had
no
head
for
great
combinations
instead
of
profiting
by
the
advice
of
those
able
soldiers
lannes
and
ney
he
spent
his
time
quarrelling
with
them
he
accordingly
kept
his
troops
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
danube
with
the
result
that
in
spite
of
neys
brilliant
action
at
elchingen
two
divisions
of
the
austrians
under
the
archduke
ferdinand
escaped
from
ulm
prince
murat
however
retrieved
his
error
by
his
brilliant
pursuit
of
the
escaped
austrians
and
by
hard
riding
and
fighting
captured
quite
half
of
the
archdukes
command

impetuosity
perseverance
and
dash
are
undoubtedly
useful
traits
in
the
character
of
a
cavalry
commander
and
of
these
he
had
his
fair
share
but
his
jealousy
and
vanity
often
led
him
astray
during
the
advance
down
the
danube
in
his
desire
to
gain
the
credit
of
capturing
vienna
he
lost
touch
completely
with
the
russians
and
austrians
who
had
retreated
across
the
danube
at
krems
and
he
involved
the
emperor
in
a
dangerous
position
by
leaving
the
unbeaten
russians
on
the
flank
of
his
line
of
communications
but
the
prince
quickly
made
amends
for
his
rashness
the
ruse
by
which
he
and
lannes
captured
the
bridge
below
vienna
was
discreditable
no
doubt
from
the
point
of
view
of
morality
it
was
a
direct
lie
to
tell
the
austrian
commander
that
an
armistice
had
been
arranged
and
the
bridge
ceded
to
the
french
but
the
fact
remains
that
murat
saved
the
emperor
and
the
french
army
from
the
difficult
and
costly
operation
of
crossing
the
broad
danube
in
the
face
of
the
allies
a
few
days
later
the
princes
vanity
postponed
for
some
time
the
culminating
blow
for
although
he
had
so
successfully
bluffed
the
enemy
he
could
not
realise
that
they
could
deceive
him
and
believing
their
tales
of
an
armistice
he
allowed
the
allies
to
escape
from
napoleons
clutches
at
hollabrünn
at
austerlitz
the
prince
marshal
covered
himself
with
glory
in
command
of
the
left
wing
ably
backed
by
lannes
he
threw
the
whole
weight
of
his
cavalry
on
the
russians
demonstrating
to
the
full
the
efficacy
of
a
welltimed
succession
of
charges
on
broken
infantry
and
giving
a
masterly
lesson
in
the
art
of
reforming
disorganised
horsemen
by
the
use
he
made
of
the
solid
ranks
of
lannes
infantry
from
behind
which
he
issued
again
and
again
in
restored
order
to
fall
on
the
shaken
ranks
of
the
enemy
at
austerlitz
he
was
at
his
best
his
old
quarrel
with
lannes
was
for
the
moment
forgotten
his
lieutenants
nansouty
dhautpoul
and
sébastiani
were
too
far
below
him
to
cause
him
any
jealousy
the
action
on
the
left
was
mainly
one
of
cavalry
in
which
quickness
of
eye
and
decision
were
everything
where
a
fault
could
be
retrieved
by
charging
in
person
at
the
head
of
the
staff
or
by
a
few
fierce
words
to
a
regiment
slightly
demoralised
rapidity
of
action
and
a
selfconfidence
which
on
the
battlefield
never
felt
itself
beaten
were
the
cause
of
murats
success

it
was
the
fixed
policy
of
napoleon
to
secure
the
rhine
valley
so
that
never
again
would
it
be
possible
for
the
austrians
to
threaten
france
to
gain
this
end
he
originated
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
grouping
all
the
small
rhineland
states
in
a
confederation
of
which
he
himself
was
the
protector
and
binding
the
rulers
of
the
individual
states
to
his
dynasty
either
by
marriage
or
by
rewards
as
part
of
this
scheme
the
emperor
allotted
to
murat
and
caroline
the
duchies
of
cleves
and
berg
welding
them
into
one
province
under
the
title
of
the
grand
duchy
of
berg
thus
the
gascon
innkeepers
son
became
in
1806
joachim
prince
and
grand
admiral
of
france
and
grand
duke
of
berg
he
gained
this
honour
not
as
murat
the
brilliant
cavalry
general
but
as
prince
joachim
the
brotherinlaw
of
the
emperor
napoleon
the
grand
duke
and
the
grand
duchess
did
not
however
reside
long
in
their
capital
düsseldorf
they
infinitely
preferred
paris
in
their
eyes
berg
was
but
a
steppingstone
to
higher
things
a
source
of
profit
and
a
pretext
for
exalting
themselves
at
the
expense
of
their
neighbours
the
grand
duke
entrusted
the
interior
management
of
the
duchy
to
his
old
friend
agar
who
had
served
him
well
in
italy
and
who
later
became
count
of
mosburg
any
prosperity
which
the
grand
duke
enjoyed
was
entirely
due
to
the
financial
ability
of
agar
murat
however
kept
foreign
affairs
in
his
own
hands
as
foreign
minister
by
simply
taking
what
he
wanted
he
added
considerably
to
the
extent
of
his
duchy
but
like
all
napoleons
satellites
he
constantly
found
his
position
humiliating
for
in
spite
of
his
tears
and
prayers
he
had
continually
to
see
his
duchy
sacrificed
to
france
it
was
no
use
to
complain
that
napoleon
had
taken
away
the
fortress
of
wesel
which
had
been
handed
over
to
the
grand
duchy
by
special
treaty
by
the
king
of
prussia
for
as
queen
hortense
wisely
asked
him
who
had
really
made
that
treaty
who
had
given
him
the
duchy
the
fortress
and
everything

in
september
1806
murats
second
and
last
visit
to
düsseldorf
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
close
by
the
opening
of
the
prussian
campaign
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
jena
his
cavalry
covered
forty
miles
and
arrived
in
time
to
give
the
enemy
the
coupdegrâce
on
the
following
day
driving
them
in
flight
into
weimar
then
followed
the
famous
pursuit
across
prussia
in
which
murat
captured
firstclass
fortresses
with
cavalry
regiments
and
divisions
of
infantry
with
squadrons
of
horse
and
ended
by
seizing
blücher
and
the
whole
of
the
prussian
artillery
on
the
shore
of
the
baltic
at
lübeck
but
though
his
cavalry
had
thus
wiped
the
prussian
army
out
of
existence
the
war
dragged
on
for
as
in
1805
the
russians
had
entered
the
field
in
november
the
emperor
despatched
his
brotherinlaw
to
command
the
french
corps
which
were
massing
round
warsaw
the
grand
duke
read
into
this
order
the
idea
that
he
was
destined
to
become
the
king
of
a
revived
poland
accordingly
he
made
a
triumphant
entry
into
warsaw
in
a
fantastic
uniform
red
leather
boots
tunic
of
cloth
of
gold
swordbelt
glittering
with
diamonds
and
a
huge
busby
of
rich
fur
bedecked
with
costly
plumes
the
poles
greeted
him
with
enthusiasm
and
murat
hastened
to
write
to
the
emperor
that
the
poles
desired
to
become
a
nation
under
a
foreign
king
given
them
by
your
majesty
while
the
grand
duke
dreamed
of
his
polish
crown
the
climate
defeated
the
french
troops
and
when
the
emperor
arrived
at
the
front
the
prince
had
to
lay
aside
his
royal
aspirations
but
in
spite
of
his
disappointment
he
was
still
too
much
of
a
frenchman
and
a
soldier
to
allow
his
personal
resentment
to
overcome
his
duty
to
his
emperor
and
he
continued
to
hope
that
by
his
daring
and
success
he
might
still
win
his
polish
crown
at
eylau
he
showed
his
customary
bravery
and
his
magnificent
talent
as
a
cavalry
leader
when
he
saved
the
shattered
corps
of
augereau
by
a
successful
charge
of
over
twelve
thousand
sabres
at
the
battle
of
heilsberg
the
celebrated
light
cavalryman
lasalle
saved
his
life
but
a
few
minutes
later
the
grand
duke
was
able
to
cry
quits
by
himself
rescuing
lasalle
from
the
midst
of
a
russian
charge
unfortunately
for
murat
the
prospective
alliance
with
russia
once
and
for
all
compelled
napoleon
to
lay
aside
all
thought
of
reviving
the
kingdom
of
poland
and
when
the
wouldbe
king
arrived
with
a
polish
guard
of
honour
and
his
fantastic
uniform
he
was
met
by
the
biting
words
of
the
emperor
go
and
put
on
your
proper
uniform
you
look
like
a
clown

after
tilsit
the
disappointed
grand
duke
returned
to
paris
where
his
equally
ambitious
wife
had
been
intriguing
with
josephine
talleyrand
and
fouché
to
get
her
husband
nominated
napoleons
successor
in
case
the
accidents
of
the
campaign
should
remove
the
emperor
but
napoleon
had
no
intention
of
dying
without
issue
thanks
to
his
brotherinlaws
generosity
murat
was
able
to
neglect
his
halfmillion
subjects
in
berg
and
spend
his
revenues
right
royally
in
paris
but
early
in
1808
his
ambition
was
once
again
inflamed
by
the
hope
of
a
crownnot
a
revived
kingship
in
poland
but
the
ancient
sceptre
of
spain
napoleon
had
decided
that
the
pyrenees
should
no
longer
exist
and
that
portugal
and
spain
should
become
french
provinces
ruled
by
puppets
of
his
own
junot
already
held
portugal
it
seemed
as
if
it
needed
but
a
vigorous
movement
to
oust
the
bourbons
from
madrid
family
quarrels
had
already
caused
a
revolution
in
spain
charles
had
fled
the
kingdom
leaving
the
throne
to
his
son
ferdinand
both
had
appealed
to
napoleon
consequently
there
was
a
decent
pretext
for
sending
a
french
army
into
spain
on
february
25th
murat
was
despatched
at
a
few
hours
notice
with
orders
to
take
over
the
supreme
command
of
all
the
french
corps
which
were
concentrating
in
spain
to
seize
the
fortresses
of
pampeluna
and
st
sebastian
and
to
advance
with
all
speed
on
madrid
but
he
was
given
no
clue
as
to
what
the
emperors
ulterior
object
might
be
he
was
ordered
however
to
keep
the
emperor
daily
informed
of
the
state
of
public
opinion
in
spain
prince
joachim
very
soon
perceived
that
king
charles
was
rejected
by
everybody
that
the
prime
minister
the
prince
of
peace
was
extremely
unpopular
and
that
ferdinand
was
weak
and
irresolute
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
follow
the
example
of
the
king
of
portugal
and
would
flee
to
the
colonies
when
the
french
army
approached
his
capital
the
only
disquieting
feature
of
the
situation
was
the
constant
annihilation
of
small
parties
of
french
soldiers
and
the
brutal
murder
of
all
stragglers
on
march
23rd
the
french
army
entered
madrid
all
was
tranquil
meanwhile
the
exking
charles
had
retired
to
bayonne
and
by
the
orders
of
the
emperor
the
prince
of
peace
was
sent
there
also
whereupon
king
ferdinand
fearing
that
napoleon
might
take
his
fathers
part
hurried
off
to
france
at
bayonne
both
the
claimants
to
the
spanish
throne
surrendered
their
rights
to
the
emperor
while
at
madrid
murat
hoping
against
hope
played
the
royal
part
and
kept
the
inhabitants
quiet
with
bullfights
and
magnificent
fêtes
so
far
the
spaniards
though
restless
were
waiting
to
see
whether
the
french
were
friends
as
they
protested
or
in
reality
stealthy
foes
the
crisis
came
on
may
2nd
when
the
french
troops
were
compelled
to
evacuate
madrid
on
account
of
the
fury
of
the
populace
at
the
attempted
abduction
of
the
little
prince
don
francisco
murat
showed
to
the
full
his
indomitable
courage
fighting
fiercely
not
only
for
his
emperor
but
for
the
crown
which
he
thought
was
his
bitter
indeed
were
his
feelings
when
he
received
a
letter
dated
that
fatal
day
may
2nd
informing
him
that
joseph
was
to
be
king
of
spain
and
that
he
might
choose
either
portugal
or
naples
as
his
kingdom
in
floods
of
tears
he
accepted
naples
but
so
cruel
was
the
blow
that
his
health
gave
way
and
instead
of
hurrying
off
to
his
new
kingdom
he
had
to
spend
the
summer
drinking
the
waters
at
barèges
his
sensitive
gascon
feelings
had
completely
broken
down
under
the
disappointment
and
for
the
time
being
he
was
physically
and
morally
a
wreck

murat
was
in
no
hurry
to
commence
his
reign
and
his
subjects
showed
no
great
anxiety
to
see
their
new
ruler
but
when
king
joachim
napoleon
to
give
him
his
new
title
arrived
at
naples
he
was
received
with
unexpected
warmth
the
new
monarch
with
his
striking
personality
and
good
looks
at
once
captivated
the
hearts
of
his
fickle
southern
subjects
joseph
had
been
prudent
and
cold
joachim
was
ostentatious
and
fiery
the
neapolitans
had
never
really
cared
for
their
bourbon
sovereigns
some
of
the
noblesse
had
from
interest
clung
to
the
old
dynasty
but
the
greater
part
of
the
nobility
cared
little
who
ruled
them
so
long
as
their
privileges
were
not
interfered
with
among
the
middle
class
there
was
a
strong
party
which
had
accepted
the
doctrines
of
the
french
revolution
the
lower
class
were
idle
and
lazy
and
willing
to
serve
any
sovereign
who
appealed
to
them
by
ostentation
the
people
who
really
held
the
key
of
the
hearts
of
the
mass
of
the
population
were
the
clergy
joseph
with
his
liberal
ideas
had
attempted
to
free
the
people
from
clerical
thraldom
joachim
however
with
his
southern
instincts
refused
to
deny
himself
the
use
of
such
a
powerful
lever
and
quickly
ingratiated
himself
with
his
new
subjects
from
the
moment
that
he
arrived
at
naples
the
new
king
determined
if
not
to
rule
naples
for
the
neapolitans
at
least
by
pretending
to
do
so
to
rule
naples
for
himself
and
not
for
napoleon
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
before
the
close
of
the
year
1808
friction
arose
which
was
further
increased
by
the
intrigues
of
talleyrand
and
fouché
these
ministers
firmly
convinced
that
napoleon
would
never
return
from
the
spanish
war
had
decided
that
in
the
event
of
his
death
they
would
declare
murat
his
successor
rather
than
establish
a
regency
for
the
young
son
of
louis
napoleon
the
king
of
holland

in
pursuance
of
the
plan
of
winning
his
subjects
affections
joachim
had
at
once
called
to
his
aid
agar
who
had
so
successfully
managed
the
finances
of
the
grand
duchy
of
berg
the
difficulties
of
finance
in
naples
were
very
great
and
with
agar
the
king
had
to
associate
the
subtle
corsican
salicetti
who
had
so
powerfully
contributed
to
the
rise
of
napoleon
taxation
in
naples
was
heavy
for
the
neapolitans
had
to
find
the
money
for
the
war
with
their
old
dynasty
which
was
threatening
them
from
sicily
aided
by
the
english
fleet
to
secure
the
kingdom
against
the
sicilians
and
english
a
large
neapolitan
army
of
thirty
thousand
troops
had
to
be
maintained
along
with
an
auxiliary
force
of
ten
thousand
french
moreover
the
neapolitans
had
to
pay
for
having
a
king
like
joachim
and
a
queen
consort
like
caroline
the
royal
household
alone
required
1395000
ducats
per
annum
to
meet
this
heavy
expense
the
ministers
had
to
devise
all
sorts
of
expedients
to
raise
money
regular
taxation
monopolies
mortgages
and
loans
barely
sufficed
to
provide
for
the
budget
still
the
king
managed
to
retain
his
popularity
and
in
his
own
way
attempted
to
ameliorate
the
lot
of
his
subjects
he
introduced
the
code
napoleon
he
founded
a
military
college
an
artillery
and
engineer
college
a
naval
college
a
civil
engineer
college
and
a
polytechnic
school
he
also
instituted
primary
schools
in
every
commune
and
started
an
école
normale
for
the
training
of
teachers
he
expanded
the
staff
of
the
university
and
established
an
observatory
and
botanical
garden
at
naples
he
attempted
to
conciliate
the
neapolitan
noblesse
by
gradually
dismissing
his
french
ministers
and
officers
and
appointing
neapolitan
nobles
in
their
place
at
the
same
time
he
abolished
feudal
dues
and
customs
he
also
attempted
to
develop
industries
by
giving
them
protection
above
all
by
the
strict
measures
of
his
minister
manhes
he
established
peace
in
the
interior
by
breaking
down
the
organised
system
of
the
freebooters
and
robbers
as
time
went
on
he
found
that
the
clergy
and
monks
were
too
heavy
a
burden
for
his
kingdom
to
bear
and
at
the
expense
of
his
popularity
he
had
to
cut
down
the
numbers
of
the
dioceses
and
parishes
and
abolish
the
religious
orders

from
the
first
the
new
king
grasped
the
fact
that
his
kingdom
would
always
be
heavily
taxed
and
his
throne
insecure
as
long
as
the
bourbons
backed
by
the
english
held
sicily
his
plan
of
campaign
therefore
was
to
drive
his
enemy
out
of
the
smaller
islands
and
thereafter
to
demand
the
aid
of
french
troops
and
make
a
determined
effort
against
sicily
in
october
1808
by
a
wellplanned
expedition
he
captured
the
island
of
capri
and
caused
the
english
commander
sir
hudson
lowe
to
capitulate
it
was
not
till
the
autumn
of
1810
however
that
he
was
ready
for
the
great
expedition
relying
on
the
traditional
hatred
of
the
people
of
messina
for
the
bourbons
he
collected
a
strong
force
on
the
straits
and
waited
till
the
moment
when
after
a
gale
the
english
fleet
had
not
yet
arrived
from
the
roads
of
messina
on
the
evening
of
september
17th
he
sent
away
his
advance
guard
of
two
thousand
men
in
eighty
small
boats
cavaignac
the
commander
of
this
force
secured
the
important
villages
of
santo
stefano
and
santo
paolo
but
at
the
critical
moment
the
commander
of
the
french
division
acting
according
to
the
emperors
orders
refused
to
allow
his
troops
to
cross
before
fresh
arrangements
could
be
made
the
english
fleet
reappeared
on
the
scene
and
cavaignac
and
his
force
were
thus
sacrificed
for
no
purpose
joachim
as
time
showed
never
forgave
the
emperor
for
the
failure
of
his
cherished
plan

by
the
commencement
of
1812
the
coming
russian
campaign
overshadowed
all
other
questions
murat
who
had
earnestly
begged
to
be
allowed
to
share
the
austrian
campaign
of
1809
was
delighted
to
serve
in
person
but
as
king
of
naples
he
refused
to
send
a
division
of
ten
thousand
men
to
reinforce
the
grand
army
as
a
frenchman
and
a
soldier
he
declared
himself
to
the
core
a
subject
of
the
emperor
but
as
king
of
naples
he
aspired
to
perfect
independence
it
was
this
double
attitude
which
from
the
moment
murat
became
king
clouded
the
relations
between
him
and
napoleon
but
nevertheless
once
he
rejoined
the
emperor
at
dantzig
he
laid
aside
all
his
royal
aspirations
and
became
the
faithful
dashing
leader
of
cavalry

during
the
advance
on
moscow
the
cavalry
suffered
terribly
from
the
difficulties
of
constant
reconnaissances
and
want
of
supplies
but
in
spite
of
this
murat
urged
the
emperor
not
to
halt
at
smolensk
but
to
push
on
as
he
believed
the
russians
were
becoming
demoralised
scarce
a
day
passed
without
some
engagement
in
which
the
king
of
naples
showed
his
audacity
and
his
talent
as
a
leader
notwithstanding
napoleon
angry
at
the
constant
escape
of
the
russians
declared
that
if
murat
had
only
pursued
bagration
in
lithuania
he
would
not
have
escaped
this
reproach
spurred
on
the
king
of
naples
to
even
greater
deeds
of
bravery
and
so
well
was
his
figure
known
to
the
enemy
that
the
cossacks
constantly
greeted
him
with
cries
of
hurrah
hurrah
murat
at
the
battle
of
moskowa
he
and
ney
completely
overthrew
the
russians
and
if
napoleon
had
flung
the
guard
into
the
action
the
russian
army
would
have
been
annihilated
in
spite
of
the
losses
during
the
campaign
when
the
french
evacuated
moscow
murat
had
still
ten
thousand
mounted
troops
but
by
the
time
the
army
had
reached
the
beresina
there
remained
only
eighteen
hundred
troopers
with
horses
when
the
emperor
deserted
the
grand
army
he
left
the
king
of
naples
in
command
with
orders
to
rally
the
army
at
vilna
but
murat
saw
that
it
was
impossible
to
reform
the
army
there
and
accordingly
ordered
a
retirement
across
the
niemen
a
line
which
he
soon
found
it
was
impossible
to
hold
on
january
10
1813
came
the
news
that
the
prussians
had
actually
gone
over
to
the
enemy
it
seemed
as
if
napoleon
was
lost
and
murat
thereupon
at
once
deserted
the
army
and
set
out
in
all
haste
for
italy
thinking
only
of
how
to
save
his
crown

the
king
arrived
in
naples
bent
on
maintaining
his
crown
and
on
allowing
no
interference
from
the
emperor
but
in
spite
of
this
he
could
not
decide
on
any
definite
line
of
action
he
was
afraid
the
english
and
russians
would
invade
his
country
but
on
the
other
hand
his
old
affection
for
napoleon
and
a
sort
of
sneaking
belief
in
his
ultimate
success
prevented
him
from
listening
to
the
insidious
advice
of
the
austrian
envoy
whom
the
farseeing
metternich
had
at
once
sent
to
naples
if
napoleon
had
not
in
his
despatch
glorified
prince
eugènes
conduct
to
the
disparagement
of
the
king
of
naples
if
he
had
only
vouchsafed
some
reply
to
the
kings
persistent
letters
of
inquiry
whether
he
still
trusted
his
old
comrade
and
lieutenant
murat
would
have
thrown
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
mêlée
on
the
side
of
his
old
friend
but
in
april
napoleon
quitted
paris
for
the
army
in
germany
without
sending
one
line
in
reply
to
these
imploring
letters
meanwhile
on
april
23rd
came
a
letter
from
colonel
coffin
suggesting
the
possibility
of
effecting
an
entente
between
the
english
and
neapolitan
governments
or
at
any
rate
a
commercial
convention
thereupon
murat
sent
officers
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
lord
william
bentinck
who
represented
the
english
government
in
sicily
all
through
the
summer
the
negotiations
were
continued
but
murat
in
spite
of
the
guarantee
of
the
throne
of
naples
which
the
english
offered
could
not
break
entirely
with
his
emperor
and
benefactor
still
napoleon
in
his
blindness
instead
of
attempting
to
conciliate
his
brotherinlaw
allowed
articles
to
his
disparagement
to
appear
in
the
moniteur
nevertheless
murat
at
bottom
was
napoleons
man
elated
by
the
emperors
success
at
lützen
and
bautzen
although
he
refused
to
allow
the
neapolitan
troops
to
join
the
army
of
italy
under
prince
eugène
he
hurried
off
in
august
to
join
the
french
army
at
dresden
there
a
reconciliation
took
place
between
the
brothersinlaw
but
after
the
defeat
at
leipzig
king
joachim
asked
and
obtained
leave
to
return
to
his
own
dominions

his
presence
was
needed
at
home
for
in
italy
also
the
war
had
gone
against
the
french
prince
eugène
had
had
to
fall
back
on
the
line
of
the
adda
and
the
defection
of
the
tyrol
had
opened
to
the
allies
the
passes
into
the
peninsula
murat
in
his
hurry
had
to
leave
his
coach
snowed
up
in
the
simplon
pass
and
proceed
on
horseback
to
milan
where
he
halted
but
a
few
hours
to
write
a
despatch
to
the
emperor
which
practically
foretold
his
desertion
he
declared
that
if
he
instead
of
eugène
was
entrusted
with
the
defence
of
italy
he
would
at
once
march
north
from
naples
with
forty
thousand
men
he
had
indeed
never
forgotten
the
slight
put
upon
him
by
the
article
in
the
moniteur
after
the
russian
campaign
and
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
even
his
kingdom
if
only
he
could
revenge
himself
on
his
enemy
eugène
as
napoleon
would
not
grant
him
this
request
he
determined
to
humiliate
eugène
and
at
the
same
time
to
save
his
crown
by
negotiating
with
the
enemy
on
reaching
naples
he
found
that
his
wife
who
hitherto
had
been
an
unbending
partisan
of
the
french
had
entirely
changed
her
politics
and
was
now
pledged
to
an
austrian
alliance
the
king
was
ever
unstable
vanity
always
governed
his
conduct
the
queen
was
always
determined
governed
solely
by
a
cold
calculating
ambition
negotiations
were
at
once
opened
with
the
austrians
the
king
protested
that
he
desired
nothing
in
the
world
so
much
as
to
make
common
cause
with
the
allied
powers
he
promised
that
he
would
join
them
with
thirty
thousand
troops
on
condition
that
he
was
guaranteed
the
throne
of
naples
and
that
he
should
have
the
roman
states
in
exchange
for
sicily
meanwhile
he
addressed
an
order
of
the
day
to
his
army
stating
that
the
neapolitan
troops
should
only
be
employed
in
italy
this
of
course
did
not
commit
him
either
to
napoleon
or
the
austrian
alliance
meanwhile
the
emperor
had
despatched
fouché
to
try
to
bind
his
brotherinlaw
to
france
but
that
distinguished
doubledealer
merely
advised
the
neapolitan
king
to
move
northwards
to
the
valley
of
the
po
with
all
his
troops
and
there
to
wait
and
see
whether
it
would
be
best
to
help
the
french
or
to
enter
france
with
the
allies
and
perhaps
the
tuileries
as
emperor

joachim
napoleon
quietly
occupied
rome
and
pushed
forward
his
troops
towards
the
po
using
the
french
magazines
and
depôts
but
still
negotiating
with
the
austrians
and
at
the
same
time
holding
out
hopes
to
the
purely
italian
party
for
the
national
party
of
the
risorgimento
were
striving
hard
to
seize
this
opportunity
to
unite
italy
and
drive
out
the
foreigner
and
no
one
seemed
more
capable
of
carrying
out
their
policy
than
the
popular
king
of
naples
the
austrians
flattered
the
hopes
of
young
italy
by
declaring
in
their
proclamation
that
they
had
only
entered
italy
to
free
her
from
the
yoke
of
the
stranger
and
to
aid
the
king
of
naples
by
creating
an
independent
kingdom
of
italy
still
murat
hesitated
on
the
brink
as
late
as
the
27th
of
december
he
wrote
to
the
emperor
proposing
that
italy
should
be
formed
into
two
kingdoms
that
he
should
govern
all
the
peninsula
south
of
the
po
and
that
the
rest
of
the
country
should
be
left
to
eugène
three
days
later
the
austrian
envoy
arrived
with
the
proposals
of
the
allies
but
he
could
not
yet
make
up
his
mind
and
moreover
the
english
had
not
yet
guaranteed
him
naples
in
january
however
these
guarantees
were
given
and
against
his
will
he
had
to
sign
a
treaty
scarcely
was
the
writing
dry
when
he
began
to
negotiate
with
prince
eugène
he
used
every
artifice
to
prevent
a
collision
between
the
french
and
neapolitan
troops
when
the
campaign
opened
his
troops
abandoned
their
position
at
the
first
shot
while
he
himself
took
good
care
not
to
reach
the
front
until
the
news
of
napoleons
abdication
arrived

but
murats
conduct
had
alienated
everybody
the
french
loathed
him
for
his
duplicity
the
allies
suspected
him
of
treachery
and
the
party
of
the
risorgimento
looked
on
him
as
the
cause
of
their
subjection
to
the
foreigner
for
the
austrian
victory
had
not
brought
italy
unity
and
independence
but
had
merely
established
the
fetters
of
the
old
régime
during
the
remainder
of
1814
the
lot
of
the
king
of
naples
was
most
unenviable
the
restored
bourbons
of
france
and
spain
regarded
him
as
the
despoiler
of
the
bourbon
house
of
sicily
russia
had
been
no
party
to
the
guarantee
of
his
kingdom
england
desired
nothing
so
much
as
his
expulsion
austria
alone
upheld
him
for
she
had
been
the
chief
party
to
the
treaty
but
metternich
was
waiting
for
him
to
make
some
slip
which
might
serve
as
a
pretext
for
tearing
up
that
treaty
even
the
pope
refused
the
bribe
which
the
king
offered
him
when
he
proposed
to
restore
the
marches
in
return
for
receiving
the
papal
investiture
in
despair
murat
once
again
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
italian
party
a
general
rising
was
planned
in
lombardy
but
failed
as
the
austrians
received
news
of
the
proposed
cession
of
milan
with
cruel
cunning
they
spread
the
report
that
the
king
of
naples
had
sold
the
secret
henceforward
murat
had
no
further
hope
foreigners
italians
priests
carbonari
and
freemasons
all
had
turned
against
him

such
was
the
situation
when
on
march
8
1815
the
king
heard
that
napoleon
had
left
elba
as
usual
he
dealt
double
he
at
once
sent
a
message
to
england
that
he
would
be
faithful
while
at
the
same
time
he
sent
agents
to
sicily
to
try
to
stir
up
a
revolt
against
the
bourbons
as
soon
as
the
news
of
napoleons
reception
in
france
arrived
he
set
out
at
the
head
of
forty
thousand
troops
thinking
that
all
italy
would
rise
for
him
but
the
italians
mistrusted
the
fickle
king
the
austrian
troops
were
already
mobilised
and
accordingly
early
in
may
the
neapolitan
army
fled
homewards
before
its
enemies
king
joachims
popularity
was
gone
a
grant
of
a
constitution
roused
no
enthusiasm
among
the
people
city
after
city
opened
its
gates
to
the
enemy
resistance
was
hopeless
so
on
the
night
of
may
19th
the
king
of
naples
with
a
few
hundred
thousand
francs
and
his
diamonds
accompanied
by
a
handful
of
personal
friends
fled
by
sea
to
cannes
but
the
emperor
refused
to
receive
the
turncoat
though
at
st
helena
he
bitterly
repented
this
action
lamenting
that
at
waterloo
murat
might
have
given
us
the
victory
for
what
did
we
need
to
break
three
or
four
english
squares
murat
was
just
the
man
for
the
job
after
waterloo
the
poor
king
fled
before
the
white
terror
and
for
some
time
lay
hid
in
corsica
there
he
was
given
a
safe
conduct
by
the
allies
and
permission
to
settle
in
austria
but
the
deposed
monarch
could
not
overcome
his
vanity
he
still
believed
himself
indispensable
to
naples
some
four
hundred
corsicans
promised
to
follow
him
thither
the
filibustering
expedition
set
out
in
three
small
ships
on
the
28th
of
september
a
storm
arose
and
scattered
the
armada
but
in
spite
of
this
on
october
7th
the
exking
decided
to
land
at
pizzo
dressed
in
full
uniform
amid
cries
of
long
live
our
king
joachim
the
unfortunate
man
landed
with
twentysix
followers
he
was
at
once
arrested
and
on
october
13th
tried
by
court
martial
condemned
to
death
and
executed
a
few
hours
later

joachim
murat
met
his
death
like
a
soldier
as
he
wrote
to
his
wife
his
only
regret
was
that
he
died
far
off
without
seeing
his
children
death
was
what
he
courted
when
landing
at
pizzo
for
he
must
have
known
how
impossible
it
was
for
him
to
conquer
a
kingdom
with
twentysix
men
still
he
preferred
to
die
in
the
attempt
to
regain
his
crown
rather
than
to
spend
an
ignoble
old
age
a
pensioner
on
the
bounty
of
his
enemies
murat
died
as
he
had
lived
brave
but
vain
with
his
last
words
calling
out
soldiers
do
your
duty
fire
at
my
heart
but
spare
my
face

the
king
of
naples
owed
his
elevation
entirely
to
his
fortunate
marriage
with
the
emperors
sister
otherwise
it
is
certain
he
would
never
have
reached
such
exalted
rank
for
napoleon
really
did
not
like
him
or
trust
him
and
had
a
true
knowledge
of
his
ability
he
was
a
paladin
said
the
emperor
at
st
helena
in
the
field
but
in
the
cabinet
destitute
of
either
decision
or
judgment
he
loved
i
may
rather
say
adored
me
he
was
my
right
arm
but
without
me
he
was
nothing
in
battle
he
was
perhaps
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
left
to
himself
he
was
an
imbecile
without
judgment
murat
was
a
cavalry
leader
pure
and
simple
his
love
of
horses
his
intuitive
knowledge
of
exactly
how
much
he
could
ask
from
his
horsemen
his
reckless
bravery
his
fine
swordsmanship
his
dashing
manners
captivated
the
french
cavalry
and
enabled
him
to
achieve
the
impossible
contrary
to
accepted
opinion
napoleon
believed
that
cavalry
if
led
by
equally
brave
and
resolute
men
must
always
break
infantry
consequently
we
find
that
at
austerlitz
jena
and
eylau
the
decisive
stroke
of
the
day
was
in
each
case
given
by
immense
bodies
of
some
twenty
thousand
men
under
the
command
of
murat
whose
genius
lay
in
his
ability
to
manoeuvre
these
huge
bodies
of
cavalry
on
the
field
of
battle
and
in
the
tenacity
with
which
he
clung
to
and
pursued
a
beaten
enemy
but
this
was
the
sum
total
of
his
military
ability
he
had
no
conception
of
the
use
of
the
other
arms
of
the
service
and
never
gained
even
the
most
elementary
knowledge
of
strategy
when
trusted
with
anything
like
the
command
of
a
mixed
body
of
troops
he
proved
an
utter
failure
before
ulm
he
nearly
ruined
napoleons
combination
by
failing
to
get
in
contact
with
the
enemy
in
the
later
half
of
the
campaign
of
1806
he
hopelessly
failed
to
make
any
headway
against
the
russians
east
of
the
vistula
in
the
retreat
across
the
niemen
he
proved
himself
absolutely
incapable
of
reorganising
a
beaten
force
as
a
king
murat
was
full
of
good
intentions
towards
his
people
but
his
extravagance
his
vanity
his
indecision
cost
him
his
crown
as
a
man
he
was
generous
and
extraordinarily
brave
in
the
russian
campaign
he
used
to
challenge
the
cossacks
to
single
combat
and
when
he
had
beaten
them
he
sent
them
away
with
some
medal
or
souvenir
of
himself
he
was
a
good
husband
and
lived
at
peace
and
amity
with
his
wife
and
was
exceedingly
fond
of
his
children
his
faults
were
numerous
he
was
by
nature
intensely
jealous
especially
of
those
who
came
between
him
and
napoleon
and
he
stooped
to
anything
whereby
he
might
injure
his
rivals
lannes
and
prince
eugène
his
hot
southern
blood
led
him
into
numerous
quarrels
although
extremely
arrogant
at
bottom
he
was
a
moral
coward
and
before
the
emperors
reproaches
he
scarcely
dared
to
open
his
mouth
but
his
great
fault
through
which
he
gained
and
lost
his
crown
was
his
vanity
vanity
working
on
ambition
and
an
unstable
character
is
the
key
to
all
his
career
his
blatant
jacobinism
his
intrigue
with
josephine
his
overtures
to
the
directors
his
underhand
treatment
of
his
fellow
marshals
his
discontent
with
his
grand
duchy
his
subtle
dealings
in
spain
his
system
of
government
in
naples
his
opposition
to
napoleons
schemes
his
dissimulation
and
desertion
his
almost
theatrical
bravery
and
his
very
death
were
due
to
nothing
save
extravagant
vanity

andré
masséna
marshal
duke
of
rivoli
prince
of
essling


andré
masséna
the
wiliest
of
italians
was
born
at
nice
on
may
6
1758
where
his
father
and
mother
carried
on
a
considerable
business
as
tanners
and
soap
manufacturers
on
his
fathers
death
when
andré
was
still
but
a
small
boy
his
mother
at
once
married
again
thereon
andré
and
two
of
his
sisters
were
adopted
by
their
uncle
augustine
who
proposed
to
give
his
nephew
a
place
in
his
business
but
andrés
restless
fiery
nature
could
not
brook
the
idea
of
a
perpetual
monotonous
existence
in
the
tanyard
and
soap
factory
so
at
the
age
of
thirteen
he
ran
away
from
home
and
shipped
as
a
cabin
boy
as
such
he
made
several
voyages
in
the
mediterranean
and
on
one
occasion
crossed
the
atlantic
to
cayenne
but
in
spite
of
his
love
of
adventure
the
life
of
a
sailor
soon
began
to
pall
and
on
august
18
1775
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
enlisted
in
the
royal
italian
regiment
in
the
french
service
there
he
came
under
the
influence
of
his
uncle
marcel
who
was
sergeantmajor
of
the
regiment
thanks
to
his
advice
and
care
he
made
rapid
strides
in
his
profession
and
received
a
fair
education
in
the
regimental
school
in
later
years
the
marshal
used
to
say
that
no
step
cost
him
so
much
trouble
or
gave
him
such
pleasure
as
his
promotion
to
corporal
be
that
as
it
may
promotion
came
rapidly
and
with
less
than
two
years
service
he
became
sergeant
on
april
15
1777
for
fourteen
years
masséna
served
in
the
royal
italians
but
at
last
he
retired
in
disgust
under
the
regulations
a
commission
was
unattainable
for
those
who
were
not
of
noble
birth
and
the
officers
of
the
regiment
had
taken
a
strong
dislike
to
the
sergeant
whom
the
colonel
constantly
held
up
as
an
example
telling
them
your
ignorance
of
drill
is
shameful
your
inferiors
masséna
for
example
can
manoeuvre
the
battalion
far
better
than
any
of
you
on
his
retirement
masséna
lived
at
nice
to
occupy
his
time
and
earn
a
living
he
joined
his
cousin
bavastro
and
carried
on
a
large
smuggling
business
both
by
sea
and
land
he
thus
gained
that
intimate
knowledge
of
the
defiles
and
passes
of
the
maritime
alps
which
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
in
the
numerous
campaigns
of
the
revolutionary
wars
while
the
necessity
for
keeping
a
watch
on
the
preventive
men
and
thus
concealing
his
own
movements
developed
to
a
great
extent
his
activity
resource
and
daring
so
successful
were
his
operations
that
he
soon
found
himself
in
the
position
to
demand
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
lamarre
daughter
of
a
surgeon
possessed
of
a
considerable
dowry
when
the
revolutionary
wars
broke
out
the
massénas
were
established
at
antibes
where
they
did
a
fair
trade
in
olive
oil
and
dried
fruits
but
a
respectable
humdrum
existence
could
not
satisfy
the
restless
nature
of
the
exsergeant
and
in
1791
he
applied
for
a
sublieutenancy
in
the
gendarmerie
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
on
the
principle
of
setting
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
he
would
have
made
an
excellent
policeman
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
invasion
of
france
by
the
monarchs
of
europe
caused
all
patriotic
frenchmen
to
obey
the
summons
to
arms
masséna
gladly
left
his
shop
to
serve
as
adjutant
of
the
volunteers
of
the
var
his
military
knowledge
his
erect
and
proud
bearing
his
keen
incisive
speech
and
absolute
selfconfidence
in
all
difficulties
soon
dominated
his
comrades
and
it
was
as
lieutenantcolonel
commanding
the
second
battalion
that
he
marched
to
the
frontier
to
meet
the
enemy
lean
and
spare
below
middle
height
with
a
highly
expressive
italian
face
a
good
mouth
an
aquiline
nose
and
black
sparkling
eyes
from
the
very
first
masséna
inspired
confidence
in
all
who
met
him
but
it
was
not
till
he
was
seen
in
action
that
the
greatness
of
his
qualities
could
best
be
appreciated
as
napoleon
said
of
him
at
st
helena
masséna
was
at
his
best
and
most
brilliant
in
the
middle
of
the
fire
and
disorder
of
battle
the
roar
of
the
cannon
used
to
clear
his
ideas
give
him
insight
penetration
and
gaiety
in
the
middle
of
the
dead
and
dying
among
the
hail
of
bullets
which
swept
down
all
around
him
masséna
was
always
himself
giving
his
orders
and
making
his
dispositions
with
the
greatest
calmness
and
good
judgment
there
you
see
the
true
nobility
of
blood
in
the
saddle
from
morning
till
night
absolutely
insensible
to
fatigue
ready
at
any
moment
to
take
the
responsibility
of
his
actions
he
returned
from
the
first
campaign
in
the
riviera
as
majorgeneral
during
the
siege
of
toulon
he
commanded
the
camp
de
milles
fourches
which
included
the
company
of
artillery
commanded
by
bonaparte
and
distinguished
himself
by
taking
the
forts
of
lartigues
and
st
catharine
thus
earning
his
step
as
lieutenantgeneral
while
his
future
commander
was
still
a
major
in
the
artillery
in
the
campaign
of
1794
it
was
masséna
who
conceived
and
carried
out
the
turning
movement
which
drove
the
sardinians
from
the
col
de
tenda
while
bonapartes
share
in
the
action
merely
consisted
of
commanding
the
artillery
as
the
trusted
counsellor
of
dumerbion
kellermann
and
schérer
for
the
next
two
years
the
lieutenantgeneral
was
the
inspirer
of
the
successive
commanders
of
the
army
of
italy
he
it
was
who
amid
the
snow
and
storms
planned
and
carried
out
the
combinations
which
gained
for
schérer
the
great
winter
victory
at
loano
and
thus
first
taught
the
french
the
secret
which
the
english
had
grasped
on
the
sea
and
napoleon
was
to
perfect
on
land
of
breaking
the
enemys
centre
and
falling
on
one
wing
with
overwhelming
force
the
campaign
of
1796
for
the
time
being
altered
the
current
of
massénas
military
life
before
the
young
corsicans
eagle
gaze
even
the
impetuous
italian
quailed
and
from
being
the
brain
of
the
officer
commanding
the
army
he
had
to
revert
to
the
position
of
the
right
arm
and
faithful
interpreter
of
orders
two
things
however
compensated
masséna
for
the
change
of
rôle
for
bonaparte
gave
his
subordinate
fighting
and
glory
with
a
lavish
hand
and
above
all
winked
at
nay
rather
encouraged
the
amassing
of
booty
and
wealth
more
even
than
glory
was
the
desire
of
massénas
soul

illustration
andré
masséna
prince
of
essling

at
the
very
commencement
of
the
campaign
masséna
committed
a
fault
which
almost
ruined
his
career
after
defeating
the
enemys
advance
guard
near
cairo
hearing
by
chance
that
the
austrian
officers
had
left
an
excellent
dinner
in
a
neighbouring
inn
he
and
some
of
his
staff
left
his
division
on
the
top
of
a
high
hill
and
set
off
to
enjoy
the
good
things
prepared
for
the
enemy
at
daybreak
the
enemy
attempted
a
surprise
on
the
french
position
on
the
hill
and
the
troops
without
their
general
and
staff
were
in
great
danger
fortunately
masséna
had
time
to
make
his
way
through
the
austrian
skirmishers
and
resume
his
command
he
was
greeted
by
hoots
and
jeers
but
with
absolute
imperturbability
he
reorganised
his
forces
and
checked
the
enemy
but
one
battalion
was
isolated
on
a
spur
from
which
there
seemed
no
way
of
escape
save
under
a
scorching
flank
fire
masséna
made
his
way
alone
to
this
detached
post
scrambling
up
the
steep
slope
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
when
he
at
last
reached
the
troops
remembering
his
old
smuggling
expedients
he
showed
them
how
to
glissade
down
the
steep
part
of
the
hill
and
brought
them
all
safely
back
without
a
single
casualty
this
escapade
came
to
bonapartes
ears
and
it
was
only
massénas
great
share
in
the
victory
of
montenotte
which
saved
him
from
a
courtmartial

bonaparte
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
had
ended
a
letter
of
instructions
to
his
lieutenant
with
the
words
watchfulness
and
bluff
that
is
the
card
and
well
masséna
learned
his
lesson
montenotte
the
bridge
of
lodi
the
long
struggle
at
castiglione
the
two
fights
at
rivoli
and
the
marshes
of
arcola
proved
beyond
doubt
that
of
all
the
young
conqueror
of
italys
lieutenants
none
had
the
insight
activity
and
endurance
of
masséna
but
empty
flattery
did
not
satisfy
him
for
as
early
as
lonato
greedy
for
renown
he
considered
his
success
had
not
been
fully
recognised
in
bitter
anger
he
wrote
to
bonaparte
i
complain
of
your
reports
of
lonato
and
roveredo
in
which
you
do
not
render
me
the
justice
that
i
merit
this
forgetfulness
tears
my
heart
and
throws
discouragement
on
my
soul
i
will
recall
the
fact
under
compulsion
that
the
victory
of
saintes
georges
was
due
to
my
dispositions
to
my
activity
to
my
sangfroid
and
to
my
prevision
this
frank
republican
letter
greatly
displeased
bonaparte
who
since
lodi
had
cherished
visions
of
a
crown
and
to
realise
this
desire
had
begun
to
issue
his
praise
and
rewards
irrespective
of
merit
and
to
appeal
to
the
private
soldier
while
visiting
his
displeasure
on
the
officers
but
massénas
brilliant
conduct
at
the
second
battle
of
rivoli
for
the
moment
blotted
out
all
rancour
for
it
was
masséna
who
had
saved
the
day
who
had
rushed
up
to
the
commander
of
the
shaken
regiment
bitterly
upbraiding
him
and
his
officers
showering
blows
on
them
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
had
then
galloped
off
and
brought
up
two
tried
regiments
of
his
own
invincible
division
and
driven
back
the
assailants
from
that
moment
bonaparte
confirmed
him
in
the
title
of
the
spoilt
child
of
victory
in
1797
bonaparte
gave
his
lieutenant
a
more
substantial
reward
when
he
chose
him
to
carry
the
despatches
to
paris
which
reported
the
preliminary
treaty
of
leoben
thus
it
was
as
the
righthand
man
of
the
most
distinguished
general
in
europe
that
the
italian
saw
for
the
first
time
the
capital
of
his
adopted
country

in
choosing
masséna
to
carry
to
paris
the
tidings
of
peace
it
was
not
only
his
prestige
and
renown
which
influenced
bonaparte
for
paris
was
in
a
state
of
half
suppressed
excitement
and
signs
were
only
too
evident
that
the
directory
was
unstable
accordingly
the
wily
corsican
while
despatching
secret
agents
to
advance
his
cause
was
careful
to
send
as
the
bearer
of
the
good
news
a
man
who
was
well
known
to
care
for
no
political
rewards
and
who
would
be
sure
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
insidious
schemes
of
those
who
were
plotting
to
restore
the
monarchy
or
to
set
up
a
dictatorship
and
were
searching
for
a
sovereign
or
a
cæsar
as
their
political
views
suggested
it
was
for
these
reasons
and
because
he
was
tired
of
massénas
greed
and
avarice
that
bonaparte
refused
to
admit
him
among
those
chosen
to
accompany
him
to
egypt
masséna
saw
clearly
all
the
secret
intrigue
of
the
capital
and
found
little
pleasure
in
his
newly
gained
dignity
of
a
seat
among
the
ancients
for
he
was
extremely
afraid
of
a
royalist
restoration
in
which
case
he
feared
our
honourable
wounds
will
become
the
titles
for
our
proscription

tired
of
paris
in
1798
he
was
glad
to
accept
the
command
of
the
french
corps
occupying
rome
when
its
former
commander
berthier
was
called
away
to
join
the
egyptian
expedition
on
his
arrival
at
rome
to
take
over
his
new
command
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
mutiny
the
troops
were
in
rags
and
badly
fed
their
pay
was
months
in
arrear
and
meanwhile
the
civil
servants
of
the
directory
were
amassing
fortunes
at
the
expense
of
the
pope
the
cardinals
and
the
princes
of
rome
discontent
was
so
widespread
that
the
new
general
at
once
ordered
all
troops
save
some
three
thousand
to
leave
the
capital
unfortunately
massénas
record
was
not
such
as
to
inspire
confidence
in
the
purity
of
his
intentions
instead
of
obeying
the
officers
and
men
held
a
mass
meeting
to
draft
their
remonstrance
to
the
directory
in
this
document
they
accused
first
of
all
the
agents
who
had
disgraced
the
name
of
france
and
ended
by
saying
the
final
cause
of
all
the
discontent
is
the
arrival
of
general
masséna
the
soldiers
have
not
forgotten
the
extortions
and
robberies
he
has
committed
wherever
he
has
been
invested
with
the
command
the
venetian
territory
and
above
all
padua
is
a
district
teeming
with
proofs
of
his
immorality
in
the
face
of
such
public
feeling
masséna
found
nothing
for
it
but
to
demand
a
successor
and
throw
up
his
command

but
with
bonaparte
in
egypt
and
a
ring
of
enemies
threatening
france
from
all
sides
the
directors
whose
hands
were
as
soiled
as
massénas
could
ill
spare
the
spoilt
child
of
victory
accordingly
early
in
1799
the
general
found
himself
invested
with
the
important
command
of
the
army
of
switzerland
this
was
a
task
worthy
of
his
genius
and
he
eagerly
accepted
the
post
but
refused
to
abide
by
the
stipulations
the
directors
desired
to
enforce
on
him
as
according
to
their
plan
the
army
of
switzerland
was
to
form
part
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
commanded
by
joubert
masséna
had
obeyed
bonaparte
but
he
had
no
intention
of
playing
second
fiddle
to
any
other
commander
and
after
some
stormy
interviews
and
letters
he
at
last
had
his
way
as
the
year
advanced
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
on
the
army
of
switzerland
would
fall
the
full
brunt
of
the
attack
of
the
coalition
for
joubert
was
defeated
by
the
archduke
charles
at
stockach
and
thrown
back
on
the
rhine
schérer
was
defeated
in
italy
at
magnano
and
by
june
the
russians
and
austrians
had
begun
to
close
in
on
switzerland
it
was
clear
that
if
the
french
army
were
driven
out
of
switzerland
both
the
rhine
and
the
maritime
alps
would
be
turned
and
the
enemy
would
be
in
a
strong
position
from
which
to
invade
france
on
masséna
therefore
hung
all
the
hopes
of
the
directory
fortunately
for
france
the
general
was
admirably
versed
in
mountain
warfare
well
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
keeping
up
communication
between
the
different
parts
of
his
line
of
defence
masséna
skilfully
withdrew
his
outposts
as
the
enemy
pressed
on
with
the
intention
of
concentrating
his
troops
round
zurich
thereby
covering
all
the
possible
lines
of
advance
but
early
in
the
summer
his
difficulties
were
further
increased
by
the
rising
of
the
swiss
peasantry
luckily
however
the
archduke
charles
advanced
most
cautiously
while
the
aulic
council
at
vienna
unable
to
grasp
the
vital
point
of
the
problem
stupidly
sent
its
reserve
army
to
italy
to
reinforce
the
russians
under
suvaroff
by
june
5th
the
archduke
had
driven
in
all
the
outlying
french
columns
and
was
in
a
position
to
attack
the
lines
of
zurich
with
his
entire
force
thanks
however
to
massénas
courage
and
presence
of
mind
the
attack
was
driven
off
but
so
overwhelming
were
the
numbers
of
the
enemy
that
during
the
night
the
french
army
evacuated
zurich
though
only
to
fall
back
on
a
strong
position
on
mount
albis
a
rocky
ridge
at
the
north
end
of
the
lake
covered
on
one
flank
by
the
lake
and
on
the
other
by
the
river
aar
the
two
armies
for
the
time
being
lay
opposite
to
each
other
too
exhausted
after
the
struggle
to
recommence
operations
the
archduke
charles
awaited
the
arrival
from
italy
of
suvaroff
who
was
to
debouch
on
the
french
right
by
the
st
gothard
pass
but
fortune
or
rather
the
aulic
council
at
vienna
once
again
intervened
and
saved
france
the
archduke
charles
was
ordered
to
leave
fiftyfive
thousand
russians
under
korsakoff
before
zurich
and
to
march
northwards
and
across
the
rhine
protests
were
useless
the
court
of
vienna
merely
ordered
the
archduke
to
perform
the
immediate
execution
of
its
will
without
further
objections
but
even
yet
disaster
threatened
the
french
for
suvaroff
was
commencing
his
advance
by
the
st
gothard
but
masséna
at
once
grasped
the
opportunity
fortune
had
placed
in
his
power
by
opposing
him
to
a
commander
like
korsakoff
who
was
so
impressed
by
his
own
pride
that
he
considered
a
russian
company
equal
to
an
austrian
battalion
on
september
26th
by
a
masterly
series
of
manoeuvres
the
main
french
force
surprised
korsakoff
and
drove
him
in
rout
out
of
zurich
suvaroff
arrived
just
in
time
to
find
masséna
in
victorious
array
thrust
in
between
himself
and
his
countrymen
and
was
forced
to
save
himself
by
a
hurried
retreat
through
the
most
difficult
passes
of
the
alps

the
campaign
of
zurich
will
always
be
studied
as
a
masterpiece
in
defensive
warfare
the
skilful
use
the
french
general
made
of
the
mountain
passes
the
methods
he
employed
to
check
the
archdukes
advance
on
zurich
the
care
with
which
he
kept
up
communications
between
his
different
columns
the
skilful
choice
of
the
positions
of
zurich
and
mount
albis
his
return
to
the
initiative
on
every
opportunity
and
his
masterly
interposition
between
korsakoff
and
suvaroff
alone
entitle
him
to
a
high
place
among
the
great
commanders
of
history
and
masséna
was
rightly
thanked
by
the
legislature
and
hailed
as
the
saviour
of
the
country

six
weeks
after
the
victory
of
zurich
came
the
18th
brumaire
and
napoleons
accession
to
the
consulate
masséna
a
staunch
republican
was
conscious
of
the
defects
of
the
directory
but
could
not
give
his
hearty
consent
to
the
coup
détat
for
he
feared
for
the
liberty
of
his
country
still
he
said
if
france
desired
to
entrust
her
independence
and
glory
to
one
man
she
could
choose
none
better
than
bonaparte
the
latter
on
his
side
was
anxious
to
retain
massénas
affections
and
at
once
offered
him
the
command
of
the
army
of
italy
but
the
conqueror
of
zurich
foresaw
that
everything
was
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
glory
of
the
first
consul
and
it
was
only
after
great
persuasion
profuse
promises
and
appeals
to
his
patriotism
that
he
undertook
the
command
with
the
stipulation
that
i
will
not
take
command
of
an
army
condemned
to
rest
on
the
defensive
my
former
services
and
successes
do
not
permit
me
to
change
the
rôle
that
i
have
heretofore
played
in
the
wars
of
the
republic
the
first
consul
replied
by
giving
masséna
carte
blanche
to
requisition
whatever
he
wanted
and
promised
him
that
the
army
of
italy
should
be
his
first
care
but
when
masséna
arrived
at
genoa
he
discovered
as
he
had
suspected
that
bonapartes
promises
were
only
made
to
be
broken
for
he
found
the
troops
entrusted
to
his
care
the
mere
shadow
of
an
army
the
hospitals
full
bands
of
soldiers
even
whole
battalions
quitting
their
posts
and
trying
to
escape
into
france
and
the
officers
and
generals
absolutely
unable
to
contend
with
the
mass
of
misery
and
want
in
spite
of
his
able
lieutenants
soult
and
suchet
he
could
make
no
head
against
the
austrians
in
the
field
and
after
some
gallant
engagements
was
driven
back
into
genoa
where
for
two
months
he
held
out
against
famine
and
the
assaults
of
the
enemy
while
the
wretched
inhabitants
starved
the
troops
were
fed
on
a
miserable
ration
of
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
horseflesh
and
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
what
was
called
breada
horrible
compound
of
damaged
flour
sawdust
starch
hairpowder
oatmeal
linseed
rancid
nuts
and
other
nasty
substances
to
which
a
little
solidity
was
given
by
the
admixture
of
a
small
portion
of
cocoa
each
loaf
moreover
was
held
together
by
little
bits
of
wood
without
which
it
would
have
fallen
to
powder
a
revolt
threatened
by
the
inhabitants
was
checked
by
massénas
order
that
an
assemblage
of
over
five
persons
should
be
fired
on
and
the
approaches
to
the
principal
streets
were
commanded
by
guns
still
he
refused
to
surrender
as
every
day
he
expected
to
hear
the
cannon
of
the
first
consuls
army
thundering
on
the
austrian
rear
one
day
the
hopes
of
all
were
aroused
by
a
distant
roar
in
the
mountains
only
to
be
dashed
by
finding
it
to
be
thunder
it
was
simply
the
ascendancy
of
massénas
personality
which
prolonged
the
agony
and
upheld
his
authority
and
in
bitter
earnestness
the
soldiers
used
to
say
he
will
make
us
eat
his
boots
before
he
will
surrender
at
last
the
accumulated
horrors
shook
even
his
firm
spirit
and
on
june
4th
a
capitulation
was
agreed
on
the
terms
were
most
favourable
to
the
french
but
as
lord
keith
the
english
admiral
said
general
your
defence
has
been
so
heroic
that
we
can
refuse
you
nothing
however
the
sufferings
of
genoa
were
not
in
vain
for
masséna
had
played
his
part
and
held
the
main
austrian
force
in
check
for
ten
days
longer
than
had
been
demanded
of
him
thus
the
first
consul
had
time
to
fall
on
the
enemies
line
of
communication
and
it
may
be
truly
said
that
without
the
siege
of
genoa
there
could
have
been
no
marengo
masséna
had
once
again
demonstrated
the
importance
of
the
individual
in
war
as
bonaparte
wrote
to
him
during
the
siege
in
such
a
situation
as
you
are
a
man
like
you
is
worth
twenty
thousand
men
in
spite
of
this
at
st
helena
the
emperor
ever
jealous
of
his
own
glory
affected
to
despise
massénas
generalship
and
endurance
at
genoa
and
blamed
him
for
not
taking
the
offensive
in
the
field
forgetting
the
state
of
his
army
and
the
paucity
of
his
troops
but
at
the
moment
he
showed
his
appreciation
of
his
services
by
giving
him
the
command
of
the
army
when
he
himself
retired
to
paris
after
the
victory
of
marengo
unfortunately
massénas
avarice
and
greed
were
unable
to
withstand
the
temptations
of
the
position
and
the
first
consul
had
very
soon
to
recall
him
from
italy
and
mark
his
displeasure
by
placing
him
on
halfpay

for
two
years
the
disgraced
general
brooded
over
his
wrongs
in
retirement
and
showed
his
attitude
of
mind
by
voting
against
the
consulate
for
life
and
the
establishment
of
the
empire
the
gift
of
a
marshals
bâton
did
little
to
reconcile
him
to
the
emperor
for
as
he
scoffingly
replied
to
thiebaults
congratulations
oh
there
are
fourteen
of
us
so
uncertain
was
the
emperor
of
his
marshals
disposition
that
on
the
outbreak
of
the
war
with
austria
masséna
alone
of
all
the
greater
marshals
held
no
command
but
with
the
prospect
of
heavy
fighting
in
italy
the
emperor
could
not
afford
to
entrust
the
italian
divisions
to
a
blunderer
and
he
once
again
posted
masséna
to
his
old
command
the
austrians
had
occupied
the
strong
position
of
caldiero
near
the
marshes
of
arcola
and
the
french
in
vain
attempted
to
force
them
from
it
but
the
success
of
the
emperor
on
the
danube
at
last
compelled
the
archduke
john
to
fall
back
on
austria
the
marshal
at
once
commenced
a
spirited
pursuit
and
ultimately
joined
hands
with
the
grand
army
south
of
the
danube

after
the
treaty
of
pressburg
napoleon
despatched
masséna
to
conquer
naples
which
he
had
given
as
a
kingdom
to
his
brother
joseph
with
fifty
thousand
men
the
marshal
swept
through
italy
in
vain
the
gallant
queen
caroline
armed
the
lazzaroni
capua
opened
its
gates
gaeta
fell
after
twelve
days
bombardment
and
joseph
entered
naples
in
triumph
calabria
alone
offered
a
stern
resistance
and
this
resistance
the
french
brought
upon
themselves
by
their
cruelty
to
the
peasantry
whom
they
treated
as
brigands
unfortunately
his
success
in
naples
was
once
again
tarnished
by
his
greed
for
the
marshal
by
selling
licences
to
merchants
and
conniving
at
their
escape
from
the
customhouse
dues
amassed
within
a
few
months
of
his
entering
naples
a
sum
of
three
million
francs
napoleon
heard
of
this
from
his
spies
and
writing
to
him
demanded
a
loan
of
a
million
francs
the
duke
of
rivoli
replied
that
he
was
the
poorest
of
the
marshals
and
had
a
numerous
family
to
maintain
and
was
heavily
in
debt
so
he
regretted
that
he
could
send
him
nothing
unfortunately
the
emperor
knew
where
he
banked
in
leghorn
and
as
he
refused
to
disgorge
a
third
of
his
illicit
profits
the
emperor
sent
the
inspector
of
the
french
treasury
and
a
police
commissary
to
the
bank
and
demanded
that
the
three
millions
which
lay
at
his
account
there
should
be
handed
over
the
seizure
was
made
in
legal
form
the
banker
who
lost
nothing
was
bound
to
comply
with
it
masséna
on
hearing
of
this
misfortune
was
so
furious
that
he
fell
ill
but
he
did
not
dare
to
remonstrate
knowing
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
but
he
never
forgave
the
emperor
his
titles
and
a
pension
never
consoled
him
for
what
he
lost
at
leghorn
and
in
spite
of
his
cautious
habits
he
was
sometimes
heard
to
say
i
was
fighting
in
his
service
and
he
was
cruel
enough
to
take
away
my
little
savings
which
i
had
invested
at
leghorn

from
what
he
called
a
military
promenade
in
italy
the
marshal
was
summoned
early
in
1807
to
the
grand
army
in
poland
and
was
present
in
command
of
one
of
the
army
corps
at
pultusk
ostralenka
and
friedland
in
1808
he
received
his
title
of
duke
of
rivoli
and
a
pension
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
per
annum
but
in
spite
of
this
he
absented
himself
from
the
court
when
joseph
was
given
the
crown
of
spain
he
requested
his
brother
to
send
masséna
to
aid
him
in
his
new
sphere
but
the
emperor
full
of
mistrust
refused
while
the
marshal
himself
had
no
great
desire
to
serve
in
spain
when
it
was
clear
that
austria
was
going
to
seize
the
occasion
of
the
spanish
war
once
again
to
fight
france
napoleon
hastened
to
send
the
veteran
duke
of
rivoli
to
the
army
on
the
danube
at
abensberg
and
eckmühl
for
the
first
time
since
1797
he
fought
under
the
eye
of
napoleon
himself
activité
activité
vitesse
wrote
the
emperor
and
well
his
lieutenant
carried
out
his
orders
following
up
the
five
days
fighting
masséna
led
the
advance
guard
to
vienna
and
commanded
the
left
wing
at
aspernessling
standing
in
the
churchyard
at
aspern
with
the
boughs
swept
down
by
grapeshot
crashing
round
him
he
was
in
his
element
never
had
his
tenacity
his
resource
and
skill
been
seen
to
such
advantage
but
in
spite
of
his
skill
and
the
courage
of
his
troops
at
the
end
of
the
first
days
fighting
his
shattered
forces
were
driven
out
of
the
heap
of
smoking
ruins
which
marked
all
that
remained
of
aspern
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
he
had
regained
half
of
the
village
when
news
came
that
the
bridge
was
broken
and
that
he
was
to
hold
off
the
austrians
while
communication
with
the
isle
of
lobau
was
being
established
the
enemy
invigorated
by
the
news
of
the
success
of
their
plan
for
breaking
the
bridges
strained
every
nerve
to
annihilate
the
french
force
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
but
masséna
lannes
and
napoleon
worked
marvels
with
their
exhausted
troops
the
duke
of
rivoli
seemed
ubiquitous
at
one
moment
on
horseback
and
at
another
on
foot
with
drawn
sword
wherever
the
enemy
pressed
he
was
there
animating
his
troops
directing
their
fire
hurrying
up
supports
thus
thanks
to
his
exertions
the
austrians
were
held
off
the
cavalry
and
the
artillery
safely
crossed
the
bridge
and
the
veteran
marshal
at
midnight
brought
the
last
of
the
rearguard
safely
to
the
isle
of
lobau
where
exhausted
by
fatigue
the
troops
fell
asleep
in
their
ranks

the
death
of
lannes
threw
napoleon
back
on
the
duke
of
rivoli
who
for
the
time
became
his
confidant
and
righthand
man
it
was
masséna
who
commanded
at
lobau
and
made
all
the
arrangements
for
the
crossing
before
wagram
the
emperor
and
his
lieutenant
were
indefatigable
in
the
care
with
which
they
made
their
preparations
on
one
occasion
wishing
to
inspect
the
austrian
position
dressed
in
sergeants
greatcoats
attended
by
a
single
aidedecamp
in
the
kit
of
a
private
they
went
alone
up
the
north
bank
of
the
island
and
took
their
coats
off
as
if
they
wanted
to
bathe
the
austrian
sentinels
seeing
as
they
thought
two
french
soldiers
enjoying
a
wash
took
no
notice
of
them
and
thus
the
emperor
and
the
marshal
were
able
to
determine
the
exact
spot
for
launching
the
bridges
on
another
occasion
while
they
were
riding
round
the
island
the
marshals
horse
put
its
foot
into
a
hole
and
fell
and
injured
the
riders
leg
so
that
he
could
not
mount
again
this
unfortunate
accident
happened
a
few
days
before
the
battle
of
wagram
so
the
duke
of
rivoli
went
into
battle
lying
in
a
light
calèche
drawn
by
four
white
horses
with
his
doctor
beside
him
changing
the
compresses
on
his
injured
leg
every
two
hours
during
the
battle
massénas
corps
formed
the
left
of
the
line
while
davout
was
carrying
out
his
great
turning
movement
it
was
the
duke
of
rivoli
who
had
to
endure
the
full
fury
of
the
austrians
attack
in
the
pursuit
after
the
battle
he
pressed
the
enemy
with
his
wonted
activity
at
the
last
encounter
at
znaim
he
had
a
narrow
escape
for
hardly
had
he
got
out
of
his
carriage
when
a
cannonball
struck
it
and
a
moment
later
another
shot
killed
one
of
the
horses

after
the
treaty
of
vienna
the
marshal
newly
created
prince
of
essling
retired
to
rest
at
his
country
house
at
rueil
but
the
emperor
could
not
spare
him
long
in
april
1810
within
eight
months
he
was
once
again
hurried
off
on
active
service
this
time
to
spain
where
soult
had
been
driven
out
of
portugal
by
sir
arthur
wellesley
and
jourdan
and
joseph
defeated
at
talavera
the
emperor
promised
the
prince
of
essling
ninety
thousand
troops
for
the
invasion
of
portugal
and
placed
under
his
command
junot
and
ney
the
marshal
did
his
best
to
refuse
the
post
he
knew
the
difficult
character
of
ney
and
the
jealousy
of
junot
and
he
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
better
to
reorganise
the
army
of
portugal
under
generals
appointed
by
himself
berthier
replied
that
the
orders
of
the
emperor
were
positive
and
left
no
point
in
dispute
when
the
emperor
delegated
his
authority
obedience
became
a
duty
however
great
might
be
the
pride
of
the
dukes
of
elchingen
and
abrantès
they
had
enough
justice
to
understand
that
their
swords
were
not
in
the
same
line
as
the
sword
of
the
conqueror
of
zurich
still
the
prince
foresaw
the
future
and
appealed
to
the
emperor
himself
but
the
emperor
was
obdurate
you
are
out
of
humour
today
my
dear
masséna
you
see
everything
black
yourself
and
your
surroundings
to
listen
to
you
one
would
think
you
were
half
dead
your
age
a
good
reason
how
much
older
are
you
now
than
at
essling
your
health
does
not
imagination
play
a
great
part
in
your
weakness
are
you
worse
than
at
wagram
it
is
rheumatism
that
is
troubling
you
the
climate
of
portugal
is
as
warm
and
healthy
as
italy
and
will
put
you
on
your
legs
set
out
then
with
confidence
be
prudent
and
firm
and
the
obstacles
you
fear
will
fade
away
you
have
surmounted
many
worse
unfortunately
for
the
marshal
his
forebodings
were
truer
than
the
emperors
optimism
on
arriving
at
salamanca
his
troubles
began
delays
were
inevitable
before
he
could
bring
into
order
his
unruly
team
junot
and
ney
were
openly
contemptuous
regnier
hung
back
and
was
three
weeks
late
in
his
arrangements
meanwhile
all
that
masséna
saw
of
the
enemy
whom
the
emperor
had
in
past
years
stigmatised
as
the
slow
and
clumsy
english
confirmed
him
in
his
opinion
that
the
campaign
was
going
to
prove
the
most
arduous
he
had
ever
undertaken

in
spite
of
everything
operations
opened
brilliantly
for
the
french
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
fell
without
the
english
commander
making
any
apparent
effort
to
relieve
them
on
september
16th
the
invasion
of
portugal
commenced
but
losses
disease
and
garrison
duty
had
already
reduced
his
troops
to
some
seventy
thousand
men
and
the
french
found
an
enemy
behind
every
stone
while
as
the
prince
of
essling
wrote
we
are
marching
across
a
desert
women
children
and
old
men
have
all
fled
in
fact
no
guide
is
to
be
found
anywhere
still
the
english
fell
back
before
him
and
he
was
under
the
impression
that
they
were
going
to
evacuate
portugal
without
a
blow
although
he
grasped
the
fact
that
it
was
the
immense
superiority
of
the
french
cavalry
which
had
prevented
the
sepoy
general
making
any
effort
to
relieve
the
fortresses
but
on
september
26th
masséna
found
that
the
english
had
stayed
their
retreat
and
were
waiting
to
fight
him
on
the
rocky
ridge
of
busaco
unfortunately
for
his
reputation
he
made
no
reconnaissance
of
the
position
and
trusting
entirely
to
the
reports
of
ney
regnier
and
junot
who
asserted
the
position
was
much
less
formidable
than
it
looked
sustained
a
heavy
reverse
after
the
battle
his
lieutenants
urged
him
to
abandon
the
invasion
of
portugal
but
the
veteran
refused
such
timorous
advice
and
rousing
himself
soon
showed
the
energy
which
had
made
his
name
so
famous
at
zurich
and
rivoli
turning
the
position
the
french
swept
down
on
portugal
while
the
english
hurriedly
fell
back
before
them
what
caused
masséna
most
anxiety
was
the
ominous
desertion
of
the
countryside
he
was
well
aware
of
the
bitter
hatred
of
the
portuguese
and
knew
that
his
soldiers
tortured
and
hung
the
wretched
inhabitants
to
force
them
to
reveal
hidden
stores
of
provisions
but
it
was
not
until
october
10th
when
the
french
had
arrived
within
a
few
miles
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
that
he
learned
of
the
vast
entrenched
camp
which
the
english
commander
had
so
secretly
prepared
for
his
army
and
the
inhabitants
of
portugal
masséna
was
furious
and
covered
with
accusations
the
portuguese
officers
on
his
staff
que
diable
he
cried
wellington
na
pas
construit
des
montagnes
but
there
had
been
no
treachery
only
so
well
had
the
secret
been
kept
that
hardly
even
an
officer
in
the
english
army
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
work
and
as
wellington
wrote
to
the
minister
at
lisbon
on
october
6th
i
believe
that
you
and
the
government
do
not
know
where
the
lines
are
for
six
weeks
the
indomitable
marshal
lay
in
front
of
the
position
hoping
to
tempt
the
english
to
attack
his
army
now
reduced
to
sixty
thousand
men
but
wellington
who
had
planned
this
victorious
reply
to
the
axiom
that
war
ought
to
feed
war
grimly
sat
behind
his
lines
while
the
english
army
well
fed
from
the
sea
watched
the
french
writhe
in
the
toils
of
hunger
masséna
was
now
roused
and
as
his
opponent
wrote
it
is
certainly
astonishing
that
the
enemy
have
been
able
to
remain
in
this
country
so
long
it
is
an
extraordinary
instance
of
what
a
french
army
can
do
at
last
even
masséna
had
to
confess
himself
beaten
and
fall
back
on
santarem
the
winter
passed
in
a
fruitless
endeavour
on
the
part
of
the
emperor
and
the
marshal
to
force
soult
derlon
and
regnier
to
cooperate
for
an
advance
on
lisbon
by
the
left
bank
of
the
tagus
meanwhile
in
spite
of
every
effort
the
french
army
dwindled
owing
to
disease
desertion
and
unending
fatigue
so
dangerous
was
the
country
that
a
despatch
could
not
be
sent
along
the
lines
of
communication
without
an
escort
of
three
hundred
men
the
whole
countryside
had
been
so
swept
bare
of
provisions
that
a
portuguese
spy
wrote
to
wellington
saying
heaven
forgive
me
if
i
wrong
them
in
believing
they
have
eaten
my
cat

by
march
1811
it
became
clear
that
the
french
could
no
longer
maintain
themselves
at
santarem
but
so
skilful
were
massénas
dispositions
that
it
was
three
days
before
wellington
realised
that
at
last
the
enemy
had
commenced
their
retreat
never
had
the
genius
of
the
marshal
stood
higher
than
in
this
difficult
retirement
from
portugal
with
his
army
decimated
by
hunger
and
disease
with
the
victorious
enemy
always
hanging
on
his
heels
with
his
subordinates
in
open
revolt
and
a
marshal
of
france
refusing
to
obey
orders
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
he
lost
not
a
single
gun
baggagewagon
or
invalid
still
the
morale
of
his
army
was
greatly
shaken
as
he
himself
wrote
it
is
sufficient
for
the
enemy
to
show
the
heads
of
a
few
columns
in
order
to
intimidate
the
officers
and
make
them
loudly
declare
that
the
whole
of
wellingtons
army
is
in
sight
when
the
marshal
at
last
placed
his
wearied
troops
behind
the
fortress
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
almeida
he
found
his
difficulties
by
no
means
at
an
end
the
emperor
who
judged
men
only
by
results
wrote
him
a
letter
full
of
thinlyveiled
criticism
of
his
operations
while
he
found
that
the
country
round
the
fortresses
was
now
included
in
the
command
of
the
northern
army
under
bessières
accordingly
he
had
to
apply
to
that
marshal
for
leave
to
revictual
and
equip
his
troops
meanwhile
wellington
proceeded
to
besiege
almeida

by
the
end
of
april
after
a
vigorous
correspondence
with
bessières
masséna
had
at
last
reorganised
his
army
and
was
once
again
ready
to
take
the
field
against
the
english
reinforced
by
fifteen
hundred
cavalry
of
the
guard
under
bessières
at
fuentes
donoro
he
surprised
the
english
forces
covering
the
siege
of
almeida
after
a
careful
reconnaissance
at
dawn
on
may
5th
he
attacked
and
defeated
the
english
right
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
action
of
bessières
who
spoiled
his
combination
by
refusing
to
allow
the
guard
to
charge
save
by
his
orders
the
english
would
have
been
totally
defeated
masséna
wished
at
all
hazards
to
continue
the
fight
on
the
morrow
but
his
principal
officers
were
strongly
opposed
to
it
overborne
by
their
counsels
after
lying
in
front
of
the
position
for
three
days
he
withdrew
to
ciudad
rodrigo
it
was
through
no
fault
of
his
that
he
was
beaten
at
fuentes
donoro
wellington
himself
confessed
how
closely
he
had
been
pressed
when
he
wrote
lord
liverpool
was
quite
right
not
to
move
thanks
for
the
battle
of
fuentes
though
it
was
the
most
difficult
i
was
ever
concerned
in
and
against
the
greatest
odds
we
had
nearly
three
to
one
against
us
engaged
above
four
to
one
of
cavalry
and
moreover
our
cavalry
had
not
a
gallop
in
them
while
some
of
that
of
the
enemy
were
quite
fresh
and
in
excellent
order
if
bony
had
been
there
we
should
have
been
beaten

soon
after
the
battle
masséna
was
superseded
by
marmont
and
retired
to
paris
the
meeting
with
the
emperor
was
stormy
well
prince
of
essling
said
napoleon
are
you
no
longer
masséna
explanations
followed
and
the
emperor
at
last
promised
that
once
again
he
should
have
an
opportunity
of
regaining
his
glory
in
spain
but
fate
willed
otherwise
after
salamanca
when
marmont
was
recalled
masséna
set
out
again
for
spain
only
to
fall
ill
at
bayonne
and
to
return
home
and
try
to
restore
his
shattered
health
at
nice
in
1813
and
1814
he
commanded
the
eighth
military
district
composed
of
the
rhône
valley
but
he
was
getting
too
old
to
take
strenuous
measures
and
was
glad
to
make
submission
to
the
bourbons

very
cruelly
the
new
government
placed
an
affront
on
the
marshal
by
refusing
to
create
him
a
peer
of
france
under
the
plea
that
he
was
an
italian
and
a
foreigner
but
in
spite
of
this
the
prince
remained
faithful
during
the
first
part
of
the
hundred
days
and
only
went
over
to
napoleon
when
he
found
that
the
capital
and
army
had
recognised
the
emperor
at
paris
the
emperor
greeted
him
with
well
masséna
did
you
wish
to
serve
as
lieutenant
to
the
duke
of
angoulême
and
fight
me

would
you
have
hurled
me
back
into
the
sea
if
i
had
given
you
time
to
assemble
your
forces
the
old
warrior
replied
yes
sire
inasmuch
as
i
believed
that
you
were
not
recalled
by
the
majority
of
frenchmen
illhealth
prevented
the
marshal
from
actively
serving
the
emperor
but
during
the
interval
between
napoleons
abdication
and
the
second
restoration
it
fell
to
the
marshals
lot
to
keep
order
in
paris
as
governor
and
commander
of
the
national
guard
the
new
government
to
punish
him
for
the
aid
he
had
given
to
the
emperor
nominated
him
one
of
the
judges
of
marshal
ney
this
was
the
last
occasion
the
prince
of
essling
appeared
in
public
suspected
as
a
traitor
by
the
authorities
weighed
down
by
the
horror
of
neys
death
and
the
assassination
of
his
old
friend
brune
and
racked
by
disease
after
a
lingering
painful
illness
the
conqueror
of
zurich
breathed
his
last
at
the
age
of
fiftynine
on
april
4
1817
even
then
the
ultra
royalists
could
not
conceal
their
hatred
of
him
the
war
minister
clarke
duke
of
feltre
his
old
comrade
now
turned
furious
legitimist
had
hitherto
withheld
the
marshals
new
bâton
and
it
was
only
the
threat
of
massénas
soninlaw
reille
to
place
on
the
coffin
the
bâton
the
marshal
had
received
from
the
emperor
which
at
last
forced
the
government
to
send
the
emblem

great
soldier
as
he
was
massénas
escutcheon
was
stained
by
many
a
blot
his
avarice
was
disgusting
beyond
words
and
with
avarice
went
a
tendency
to
underhand
dealing
harshness
and
malice
during
the
wagram
campaign
the
marshals
coachman
and
footman
drove
him
day
by
day
in
a
carriage
through
all
the
heat
of
the
fighting
the
emperor
complimented
these
brave
men
and
said
that
of
all
the
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
men
engaged
they
were
the
bravest
masséna
after
this
felt
bound
to
give
them
some
reward
and
said
to
one
of
his
staff
that
he
was
going
to
give
them
each
four
hundred
francs
the
staff
officer
replied
that
a
pension
of
four
hundred
francs
would
save
them
from
want
in
their
old
age
the
marshal
in
a
fury
turned
on
his
aidedecamp
exclaiming
wretch
do
you
want
to
ruin
me
what
an
annuity
of
four
hundred
francs
no
no
no
four
hundred
francs
once
and
for
all
adding
to
his
staff
i
would
sooner
see
you
all
shot
and
get
a
bullet
through
my
arm
than
bind
myself
to
give
an
annuity
of
four
hundred
francs
to
any
one
the
marshal
never
forgave
the
aidedecamp
who
had
thus
urged
him
to
spend
his
money
his
harshness
was
also
well
known
and
the
excesses
of
the
french
troops
in
switzerland
naples
and
portugal
were
greatly
owing
to
his
callousness
in
the
campaign
in
portugal
he
actually
allowed
detachments
of
soldiers
to
set
out
with
the
express
intention
of
capturing
all
girls
between
twelve
and
twenty
for
the
use
of
his
men
but
while
oblivious
to
the
sufferings
of
others
as
a
father
he
was
affectionate
and
indulgent
as
he
said
after
wagram
of
his
son
prosper
that
young
scamp
has
given
me
more
trouble
than
a
whole
army
corps
so
careful
was
he
of
his
safety
that
he
refused
during
the
second
day
of
the
battle
to
allow
him
to
take
his
turn
among
the
other
aidesdecamp
but
the
young
masséna
was
too
spirited
to
endure
this
and
napoleon
hearing
of
the
occurrence
severely
reprimanded
the
marshal
staunch
republican
by
profession
blustering
and
outspoken
at
times
he
was
at
bottom
a
true
italian
and
knew
well
how
to
use
the
delicate
art
of
flattery
writing
in
1805
to
the
minister
of
war
he
thus
ends
a
despatch
i
made
my
first
campaign
with
his
majesty
and
it
was
under
his
orders
that
i
learned
what
i
know
of
the
trade
of
arms
we
were
together
in
the
army
of
italy
again
when
at
fontainebleau
he
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
an
eye
when
out
pheasant
shooting
he
attacked
berthier
as
the
culprit
although
he
knew
full
well
that
the
emperor
was
the
only
person
who
had
fired
a
shot

but
in
spite
of
all
this
meanness
and
his
many
defects
he
must
always
be
remembered
as
one
of
the
great
soldiers
of
france
a
name
at
all
times
to
conjure
with
both
napoleon
and
wellington
have
paid
their
tribute
to
his
talents
at
st
helena
the
fallen
emperor
said
that
of
all
his
generals
the
prince
of
essling
was
the
first
and
the
duke
speaking
to
lord
ros
of
the
french
commanders
said
masséna
gave
me
more
trouble
than
any
of
them
because
when
i
expected
to
find
him
weak
he
generally
contrived
somehow
that
i
should
find
him
strong
the
marshal
was
a
born
soldier
war
was
with
him
an
inspiration
being
all
but
illiterate
he
never
studied
it
theoretically
but
as
one
of
his
detractors
admits
he
was
a
born
general
his
courage
and
tenacity
did
the
rest
in
the
best
days
of
his
military
career
he
saw
accurately
decided
promptly
and
never
let
himself
be
cast
down
by
reverses
it
was
owing
to
this
obstinacy
combined
with
clear
vision
that
his
great
successes
were
gained
and
the
dogged
determination
he
showed
at
zurich
loano
rivoli
and
genoa
was
no
whit
impaired
by
success
or
by
old
age
as
he
proved
at
essling
wagram
and
before
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
like
his
great
commander
none
knew
better
than
the
prince
of
essling
that
fortune
must
be
wooed
and
as
napoleon
wrote
to
him
it
is
not
to
you
my
dear
general
that
i
need
to
recommend
the
employment
of
audacity
in
spite
of
his
ill
success
in
his
last
campaign
to
the
end
the
prince
of
essling
worthily
upheld
his
title
of
the
spoilt
child
of
victory

jules
bernadotte
marshal
prince
of
ponte
corvo
king
of
sweden


gascony
has
ever
been
the
mother
of
ambitious
men
and
many
a
ruler
has
she
supplied
to
france
but
in
1789
few
gascons
even
would
have
believed
that
ere
twenty
years
had
passed
one
gascon
would
be
sitting
on
the
bourbon
throne
of
naples
and
a
second
would
be
crown
prince
of
sweden
the
adopted
son
of
the
house
of
vasa

jean
baptiste
bernadotte
the
son
of
a
petty
lawyer
was
born
at
pau
on
january
26
1763
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
enlisted
in
the
royal
marine
regiment
and
passed
the
next
nine
years
of
his
life
in
garrison
towns
in
corsica
dauphiné
and
provence
his
first
notable
exploit
occurred
in
1788
when
as
sergeant
he
commanded
a
section
of
the
marines
whose
duty
it
was
to
maintain
order
at
grenoble
during
the
troubles
which
preceded
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
the
story
goes
that
bernadotte
was
responsible
for
the
first
shedding
of
blood
one
day
when
the
mob
was
threatening
to
get
out
of
hand
a
woman
rushed
out
of
the
crowd
and
caught
the
sergeant
a
cuff
on
the
face
whereon
the
fiery
gascon
ordered
his
men
to
open
fire
in
a
moment
the
answer
came
in
a
shower
of
bricks
blood
had
been
shed
and
from
that
moment
the
people
of
france
declared
war
to
the
death
on
the
old
régime
impetuous
generous
warmhearted
and
ambitious
for
the
next
three
years
jean
baptiste
pursued
a
policy
which
is
typical
of
his
whole
career
ready
when
at
white
heat
of
passion
to
take
the
most
extreme
measures
even
to
fire
on
the
crowd
in
calmer
moments
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
rights
of
man
and
the
wellbeing
of
his
fellows
spending
long
hours
haranguing
his
comrades
on
the
iniquity
of
kingship
and
the
necessity
of
taking
up
arms
against
all
of
noble
birth
yet
standing
firm
by
his
colonel
because
in
former
days
he
had
done
him
a
kindness
and
saving
his
officers
from
the
mutineers
who
were
threatening
to
hang
them
watching
every
opportunity
to
push
his
own
fortunes
bernadotte
pursued
his
way
towards
success
promotion
came
rapidly
colonel
in
1792
the
next
year
general
of
brigade
and
a
few
months
later
general
of
division
he
owed
his
advancement
to
the
way
in
which
he
handled
his
men
naturally
great
neither
as
tactician
or
as
strategist
he
could
carry
out
the
orders
of
others
and
above
all
impart
his
fiery
nature
to
his
troops
his
success
on
the
battlefield
was
due
to
his
personal
magnetism
whereby
he
inspired
others
with
his
own
selfconfidence
but
with
all
this
selfconfidence
there
was
blended
in
his
character
a
curious
strain
of
hesitation
again
and
again
during
his
career
he
let
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
would
gascon
to
the
backbone
full
of
craft
and
wile
with
an
eye
ever
on
the
future
at
times
he
allowed
his
restless
imagination
to
conjure
up
dangers
instead
of
forcing
it
to
show
him
the
means
to
gain
his
end
when
offered
the
post
of
general
of
brigade
and
again
when
appointed
general
of
division
he
refused
the
step
because
he
had
divined
that
jacobin
would
persecute
girondist
that
ultrajacobin
would
overthrow
jacobin
and
that
a
reaction
would
sweep
away
the
revolutionists
and
he
feared
that
the
generals
of
the
army
might
share
the
fate
of
those
who
appointed
them
after
his
magnificent
attack
at
fleurus
he
was
at
last
compelled
to
accept
promotion
by
kléber
who
rode
up
to
him
and
cried
out
you
must
accept
the
grade
of
general
of
brigade
here
on
the
field
of
battle
where
you
have
so
truly
earned
it
if
you
refuse
you
are
no
friend
of
mine
thereon
bernadotte
accepted
the
post
considering
that
he
could
if
necessary
prove
that
he
had
not
received
it
as
a
political
favour
the
years
17946
saw
bernadotte
on
continuous
active
service
with
the
army
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
now
in
the
rhine
valley
now
in
the
valley
of
the
danube
every
engagement
from
fleurus
to
altenkirchen
added
more
and
more
to
his
reputation
with
the
authorities
and
to
his
hold
on
the
affection
of
his
men
he
is
the
god
of
armies
cried
his
soldiers
as
they
followed
him
into
the
fireswept
zone
his
courage
personality
and
physical
beauty
captivated
all
who
approached
him
tall
erect
with
masses
of
coal
black
hair
the
great
hooked
nose
of
a
falcon
and
dark
flashing
eyes
indicating
moorish
blood
in
his
veins
he
could
crush
the
soul
out
of
an
incipient
revolt
with
a
torrent
of
cutting
words
and
in
a
moment
turn
the
mutineers
into
the
most
loyal
and
devoted
of
soldiers
during
the
long
revolutionary
wars
he
always
kept
before
him
the
necessity
of
preparing
for
peace
and
found
time
to
educate
himself
in
history
and
political
science
it
was
with
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
best
divisional
officers
of
the
army
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
and
a
political
power
of
no
small
importance
that
at
the
end
of
1796
bernadotte
was
transferred
with
his
division
to
the
army
of
italy
commanded
by
bonaparte
from
their
very
first
meeting
friction
arose
they
were
like
cæsar
and
pompey
the
one
would
have
no
superior
the
other
would
endure
no
equal
bonaparte
already
foresaw
the
day
when
france
should
lie
at
his
feet
he
instinctively
divined
in
bernadotte
a
possible
rival
bernadotte
accustomed
to
the
adulation
of
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
felt
the
loss
of
it
in
his
new
command
where
soldiers
and
officers
alike
could
think
and
speak
of
nobody
save
the
conqueror
of
italy
yet
neither
could
afford
to
break
with
the
other
neither
could
as
yet
foretell
what
the
future
would
bring
forth
so
amid
an
occasional
flourish
of
compliments
a
secret
and
vindictive
war
was
waged
between
the
two
as
commanderinchief
bonaparte
for
the
time
being
held
the
whip
hand
and
could
show
his
dislike
by
severe
reprimands
wherever
your
division
goes
there
is
nothing
but
complaints
of
its
want
of
discipline
bernadotte
on
his
side
anxious
to
win
renown
would
appeal
to
the
esprit
of
his
soldiers
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
and
would
spoil
bonapartes
careful
combinations
by
attempting
a
frontal
attack
before
the
turning
movement
was
effected
by
the
italian
divisions
by
the
end
of
the
campaign
it
was
clear
to
everybody
that
there
was
no
love
lost
between
the
two
after
leoben
bonaparte
was
for
the
moment
the
supreme
figure
in
france
as
plenipotentiary
at
leoben
and
commanderinchief
of
the
army
of
england
he
could
impose
his
will
on
the
directory
bernadotte
in
disgust
at
seeing
the
success
of
his
rival
for
some
time
seriously
considered
withdrawing
from
public
life
or
at
any
rate
from
france
where
his
reputation
was
thus
overshadowed
among
various
posts
the
directory
offered
him
the
command
of
the
army
of
italy
but
he
refused
them
all
till
at
last
he
consented
to
accept
that
of
ambassador
at
vienna
vienna
was
for
the
time
being
the
pole
round
which
the
whole
of
european
politics
revolved
and
accordingly
there
was
great
possibility
there
of
achieving
diplomatic
renown
but
scarcely
had
the
new
ambassador
arrived
at
his
destination
when
he
heard
of
bonapartes
projected
expedition
to
egypt
he
at
once
determined
to
return
to
france
he
felt
that
his
return
ought
to
be
marked
by
something
which
might
appeal
to
the
populace
accordingly
he
adopted
a
device
at
once
simple
and
effective

illustration
jean
baptiste
bernadotte
king
of
sweden
from
an
engraving
after
the
painting
by
hilaire
le
dru

jacobin
at
heart
when
his
interest
did
not
clash
with
his
principles
he
had
from
his
arrival
at
vienna
determined
to
show
the
princes
and
dignitaries
of
an
effete
civilisation
that
frenchmen
were
proud
of
their
revolution
and
believed
in
nothing
but
the
equality
of
all
men
he
refused
to
conform
to
court
regulations
and
turned
his
house
into
a
club
for
the
german
revolutionists
his
attitude
was
of
course
resented
and
there
was
considerable
feeling
in
vienna
against
the
french
embassy
it
only
required
therefore
a
little
more
bravado
and
a
display
of
the
tricolour
on
the
balcony
of
the
embassy
to
induce
the
mob
to
attack
the
house
immediately
this
occurred
bernadotte
lodged
a
complaint
threw
up
his
appointment
and
withdrew
to
france
as
a
protest
against
this
scoundrelly
attack
on
the
honour
of
his
country
and
the
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
men

on
his
arrival
at
paris
he
found
the
directory
shaken
to
its
foundation
sièyes
the
inveterate
constitutionmonger
who
saw
the
necessity
of
a
man
with
a
head
and
a
sword
greeted
him
joyfully
the
banishment
of
pichegru
the
death
of
hoche
the
disgrace
of
moreau
and
the
absence
of
bonaparte
had
left
bernadotte
for
the
moment
the
most
important
of
the
political
soldiers
of
the
revolution
acting
on
sièyess
advice
bernadotte
refused
all
posts
offered
him
either
in
the
army
or
in
the
government
and
awaited
developments
meanwhile
he
became
very
intimate
with
joseph
bonaparte
who
introduced
him
to
his
sisterinlaw
désiré
clary
the
clarys
were
merchants
of
marseilles
and
désiré
had
for
some
time
been
engaged
to
napoleon
bonaparte
who
had
jilted
her
on
meeting
josephine
désiré
very
bitter
at
this
treatment
accepted
bernadotte
as
she
said
in
later
life
because
i
was
told
that
he
was
a
man
who
could
hold
his
own
against
napoleon
this
marriage
was
a
masterstroke
of
policy
it
at
once
gave
bernadotte
the
support
of
the
bonaparte
family
for
bonaparte
in
his
way
was
still
fond
of
désiré
and
at
the
same
time
it
gave
bernadotte
a
partner
who
at
bottom
hated
napoleon
with
a
rancour
equal
to
his
own
after
the
disasters
in
italy
and
on
the
danube
on
july
2
1799
bernadotte
thinking
the
time
was
come
accepted
the
post
of
minister
of
war
he
speedily
put
in
the
field
a
new
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
and
by
his
admirable
measures
for
the
instruction
of
conscripts
and
for
the
collection
of
war
material
he
was
in
no
small
way
responsible
not
only
for
massénas
victory
of
zurich
but
as
napoleon
himself
confessed
for
the
triumph
of
marengo

his
term
of
office
however
was
short
for
his
colleagues
intrigued
against
him
sièyes
desired
a
man
who
would
overthrow
the
directory
and
establish
a
dictatorship
barras
was
coquetting
with
the
bourbons
bernadotte
himself
talked
loudly
of
the
safety
of
the
republic
but
had
not
the
courage
to
jump
with
sièyes
or
to
crouch
with
barras
oppressed
by
doubt
his
imagination
paralysed
his
action
and
his
personality
which
only
blazed
when
in
movement
became
dull
still
trusting
his
reputation
and
thinking
that
he
was
indispensable
to
the
directory
he
tendered
his
resignation
hoping
thus
to
check
the
intrigues
of
sièyes
and
barras
to
his
surprise
it
was
at
once
accepted
and
he
found
himself
a
mere
nonentity

on
september
14th
bernadotte
resigned
on
october
9th
napoleon
landed
at
fréjus
during
the
revolution
of
the
18th
brumaire
bernadotte
remained
in
the
background
desiring
the
safety
of
france
by
the
reorganisation
of
the
directory
hating
the
idea
of
a
dictatorship
jealous
of
the
success
of
his
rival
he
refused
to
join
the
stream
of
generals
which
hurried
to
the
feet
of
the
conqueror
of
italy
and
egypt
bonaparte
who
could
read
his
soul
like
a
book
attempted
to
draw
his
rival
into
his
net
but
as
ever
the
gascon
could
not
make
up
his
mind
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
join
in
the
conspiracy
but
at
last
he
refused
and
told
bonaparte
that
if
the
directory
commanded
him
he
would
take
up
arms
against
those
who
plotted
against
the
republic
still
even
on
the
eventful
day
he
hesitated
and
appeared
in
the
morning
among
the
other
conspirators
at
bonapartes
house
but
not
in
uniform
thinking
thus
to
serve
both
parties

during
the
years
which
succeeded
the
establishment
of
the
consulate
bernadotte
waged
an
unending
subterranean
war
against
napoleon
scarcely
a
year
passed
in
which
his
name
was
not
connected
with
some
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
first
consul
of
these
napoleon
was
well
advised
but
bernadotte
was
too
cunning
to
allow
himself
to
be
compromised
absolutely
however
much
he
might
sympathise
with
the
conspirators
and
lend
them
what
aid
he
could
he
always
refused
to
sign
his
name
to
any
document
accordingly
although
on
one
occasion
a
bundle
of
seditious
proclamations
was
found
in
the
boot
of
his
aidedecamps
carriage
the
charge
could
not
be
brought
home
on
another
occasion
when
it
was
proved
that
he
had
advanced
twelve
thousand
francs
to
the
conspirator
cerrachi
he
could
prove
that
it
was
the
price
he
had
paid
the
artist
for
a
bust
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
no
definite
proof
could
be
brought
against
him
the
first
consul
could
easily
if
he
chose
have
produced
fraudulent
witnesses
or
have
had
him
disposed
of
by
a
courtmartial
as
he
got
rid
of
the
duc
denghien
napoleon
waited
his
time
he
was
afraid
of
a
jacobin
outbreak
if
he
made
a
direct
attack
against
him
further
bernadotte
had
a
zealous
friend
and
ally
in
joseph
bonaparte
so
when
pressed
to
take
stern
measures
against
his
enemy
napoleon
always
refused
to
do
so
partly
from
policy
partly
because
of
his
former
love
for
désiré
and
partly
from
the
horror
of
a
scandal
in
his
family
which
might
weaken
his
position
when
he
seized
the
imperial
throne
accordingly
he
attempted
in
every
way
to
conciliate
his
rebellious
subject
and
at
the
same
time
to
place
him
in
positions
where
he
could
do
no
political
harm
together
with
brune
and
marmont
he
made
him
a
senator
he
offered
him
the
command
of
the
army
of
italy
and
when
bernadotte
refused
and
demanded
employment
at
home
he
posted
him
to
the
command
of
the
division
in
brittany
with
headquarters
at
rennes
but
the
first
consul
found
that
rennes
far
off
as
it
was
was
too
close
to
paris
accordingly
he
tried
to
tempt
his
jacobin
general
by
important
posts
abroad
he
proposed
in
succession
the
embassy
at
constantinople
the
captaingeneralcy
at
guadaloupe
and
the
governorship
of
louisiana
but
bernadotte
refused
to
leave
france
at
last
early
in
1803
napoleon
nominated
him
minister
to
the
united
states
three
times
the
squadron
of
frigates
got
ready
to
accompany
the
new
minister
but
each
time
the
minister
postponed
his
departure
meanwhile
war
broke
out
with
england
and
bernadotte
was
retained
in
france
as
general
on
the
unattached
list
owing
to
the
efforts
of
joseph

on
the
establishment
of
the
empire
napoleon
included
bernadottes
name
among
the
number
of
the
marshals
partly
to
please
his
brother
joseph
and
to
maintain
the
prestige
of
his
family
and
partly
as
in
the
case
of
augereau
masséna
and
jourdan
to
win
over
the
staunch
republicans
and
jacobins
to
the
imperial
régime
for
the
moment
the
emperor
achieved
his
object
the
exjacobin
proud
of
his
new
title
and
luxuriating
in
his
lately
acquired
estate
of
grosbois
was
actually
grateful
but
still
gasconlike
he
wanted
more
and
complained
he
had
not
enough
to
maintain
his
proper
state
napoleon
hearing
of
this
from
fouché
exclaimed
take
from
the
public
treasury
enough
to
put
this
right
i
want
bernadotte
to
be
content
he
is
just
beginning
to
say
he
is
full
of
attachment
for
my
person
this
may
attach
him
more
but
a
few
days
later
the
marshal
revealed
his
true
feelings
when
talking
of
napoleon
to
lucien
he
said
there
will
be
no
more
glory
save
in
his
presence
and
by
his
side
and
through
his
means
and
unfortunately
all
for
him

though
the
emperor
had
promoted
him
to
honour
it
was
no
part
of
his
scheme
to
allow
to
remain
in
paris
a
man
who
as
talleyrand
said
was
capable
of
securing
four
cutthroats
and
making
away
with
napoleon
himself
if
necessary
a
furious
beast
a
grenadier
capable
of
all
and
everything
a
man
to
be
kept
at
a
distance
at
all
cost
accordingly
the
marshal
very
soon
found
himself
sent
to
replace
mortier
in
command
of
the
army
of
hanover

for
fifteen
months
bernadotte
administered
hanover
and
the
subtle
courtesy
he
showed
to
friend
and
foe
alike
made
him
as
usual
the
adored
of
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
but
whatever
he
did
the
emperor
still
suspected
him
and
gave
the
cue
to
all
that
bernadotte
was
not
to
be
trusted
and
was
no
soldier
napoleon
always
took
care
that
bernadotte
should
never
have
under
his
command
french
soldiers
his
troops
in
1805
were
bavarians
in
1807
poles
in
1808
a
mixture
of
dutch
and
spaniards
and
in
1809
of
poles
and
saxons
berthier
working
out
the
emperors
ideas
and
himself
also
hating
bernadotte
took
care
that
in
the
allotment
of
duties
the
disagreeable
and
unimportant
tasks
should
fall
to
the
marshal
in
spite
of
the
inferiority
of
his
troops
bernadotte
as
usual
distinguished
himself
in
the
hour
of
battle
at
austerlitz
at
the
critical
moment
he
saw
that
unless
the
centre
was
heavily
supported
napoleons
plan
of
trapping
the
russians
must
fail
so
without
waiting
orders
he
detached
a
division
towards
the
northern
slopes
of
the
plateau
and
thus
materially
assisted
in
winning
the
day
but
though
quickwitted
and
alert
on
the
battlefield
he
never
shone
in
strategy
in
the
movements
which
led
up
to
a
battle
he
was
always
slow
and
inclined
to
hesitate
and
his
detractors
seized
on
this
fault
to
declare
with
napoleons
connivance
that
he
was
a
traitor
to
the
emperor
and
to
france
an
incident
of
the
campaign
of
1806
gave
the
marshals
enemies
an
excellent
opening
for
showing
their
dislike
napoleon
thinking
he
had
cornered
the
whole
prussian
army
at
jena
on
the
night
of
october
13th
sent
orders
to
bernadotte
to
fall
back
from
naumburg
and
get
across
the
prussian
line
of
retreat
in
pursuance
of
these
orders
the
marshal
left
naumburg
at
dawn
on
the
morning
of
the
14th
and
marched
in
the
direction
of
apolda
which
he
reached
in
spite
of
the
badness
of
the
roads
by
4
pm
and
thereby
captured
about
a
thousand
prisoners
but
napoleon
had
been
mistaken
in
his
calculations
the
main
prussian
force
was
not
at
jena
but
at
auerstädt
where
it
was
most
pluckily
engaged
and
beaten
by
davout
who
at
once
sent
to
ask
aid
of
bernadotte
but
the
marshal
according
to
napoleons
definite
orders
pursued
his
way
to
apolda
the
emperor
to
vent
his
dislike
against
bernadotte
and
to
cover
up
his
own
mistake
asserted
that
he
had
sent
him
orders
to
go
to
davouts
assistance
but
a
careful
examination
of
the
french
despatches
proves
that
no
such
document
existed
in
fact
the
official
despatches
completely
exonerate
bernadotte
before
the
campaign
was
finished
napoleon
had
to
give
the
marshal
the
praise
he
merited
when
aided
by
soult
and
murat
he
at
last
forced
blücher
to
surrender
with
twentyfive
thousand
men
and
all
the
prussian
artillery
at
lübeck
at
eylau
bernadottes
ill
luck
once
again
pursued
him
for
the
staff
officers
sent
to
order
him
to
march
to
the
field
of
battle
were
taken
by
the
enemy
this
misfortune
gave
another
opportunity
to
his
detractors
and
again
the
emperor
lent
his
authority
to
their
false
accusations
while
secretly
countenancing
every
attack
on
the
marshal
the
emperor
for
family
reasons
was
loth
to
come
to
an
open
breach
on
june
5
1806
he
had
created
him
prince
of
ponte
corvo
a
small
principality
in
italy
wedged
in
between
the
kingdom
of
naples
and
the
papal
states
his
reason
for
so
doing
he
explained
in
a
letter
to
his
brother
joseph
the
king
of
naples
when
i
gave
the
title
of
duke
and
prince
to
bernadotte
it
was
in
consideration
of
you
for
i
have
in
my
armies
many
generals
who
have
served
me
better
and
on
whose
attachment
i
can
count
more
but
i
thought
it
proper
that
the
brotherinlaw
of
the
queen
of
naples
should
hold
a
distinguished
position
in
your
country
it
was
for
this
reason
also
that
after
the
treaty
of
tilsit
the
emperor
presented
the
prince
with
vast
domains
in
poland
and
hanover

during
the
interval
between
the
peace
of
tilsit
and
the
outbreak
of
the
war
with
austria
in
1809
the
prince
of
ponte
corvo
returned
to
his
duty
of
administering
hanover
pursuing
his
former
policy
of
ingratiating
himself
with
everybody
he
renewed
his
old
friendships
with
all
classes
and
gained
the
goodwill
of
his
neighbours
in
denmark
and
swedish
pomerania
showing
a
suavity
which
was
in
marked
contrast
to
rigid
disciplinarians
of
the
school
of
davout
such
conduct
however
did
not
gain
the
approval
of
the
emperor
whose
policy
was
by
enforcing
the
continental
system
to
squeeze
to
death
the
hanseatic
towns
which
were
englands
best
customers

the
marshal
was
so
keenly
aware
of
the
displeasure
of
the
emperor
and
the
hatred
of
many
of
his
advisers
especially
of
berthier
the
chief
of
the
staff
that
he
actually
asked
to
be
placed
on
half
pay
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
of
1809
but
the
emperor
refused
his
request
he
had
determined
to
end
the
unceasing
struggle
between
himself
and
bernadotte
the
battle
of
wagram
gave
him
his
opportunity
on
the
first
day
of
the
battle
the
marshal
had
severely
criticised
in
the
hearing
of
some
of
his
officers
the
methods
the
emperor
had
adopted
for
crossing
the
danube
and
attacking
the
archduke
charles
boasting
that
if
he
had
been
in
command
he
would
by
a
scientific
manoeuvre
have
compelled
the
archduke
to
lay
down
his
arms
almost
without
a
blow
some
enemy
told
the
emperor
of
this
boast
on
the
next
day
bernadottes
corps
was
broken
by
the
austrian
cavalry
and
only
saved
from
absolute
annihilation
by
the
personal
exertion
of
the
marshal
and
his
staff
who
by
main
force
stopped
and
reformed
the
crowd
of
fugitives
the
emperor
arrived
on
the
scene
at
the
moment
the
marshal
had
just
succeeded
in
staying
the
rout
and
sarcastically
inquired
is
that
the
scientific
manoeuvre
by
which
you
were
going
to
make
the
archduke
lay
down
his
arms
and
before
the
marshal
could
make
reply
continued
i
remove
you
sir
from
the
command
of
the
army
corps
which
you
handle
so
badly
withdraw
at
once
and
leave
the
grand
army
within
twentyfour
hours
a
bungler
like
you
is
no
good
to
me
such
treatment
was
more
than
the
marshals
fiery
temperament
could
stand
and
accordingly
contrary
to
all
military
regulations
and
etiquette
he
issued
a
bulletin
without
the
authority
of
the
emperor
praising
the
saxon
troops
and
thus
magnifying
his
own
importance
the
emperor
was
furious
and
sent
a
private
memorandum
to
the
rest
of
the
marshals
declaring
that
independently
of
his
majesty
having
commanded
his
army
in
person
it
is
for
him
alone
to
award
the
degree
of
glory
each
has
merited
his
majesty
owes
the
success
of
his
arms
to
the
french
troops
and
to
no
foreigners
to
marshal
macdonald
and
his
troops
is
due
the
success
which
the
prince
of
ponte
corvo
takes
to
himself
it
seemed
as
if
bernadottes
career
was
finished

the
emperor
found
he
had
no
longer
any
reason
to
fear
him
and
for
the
moment
determined
to
crush
him
completely
so
when
he
heard
that
clarke
had
despatched
the
prince
to
organise
the
resistance
to
the
english
at
flushing
he
at
once
superseded
him
by
bessières
but
the
prospect
of
an
alliance
by
marriage
with
either
russia
or
austria
once
again
caused
the
emperor
to
reflect
on
the
necessity
of
avoiding
scandal
and
discord
in
his
own
family
accordingly
he
determined
to
try
and
propitiate
the
marshal
by
sending
him
as
his
envoy
to
rome
to
a
born
intriguer
like
bernadotte
rome
seemed
to
spell
absolute
exile
and
accordingly
in
the
lowest
of
spirits
he
set
about
to
find
excuse
to
delay
his
journey
little
thinking
that
fortune
had
turned
and
was
at
last
about
to
raise
him
to
those
heights
of
which
he
had
so
long
dreamed
long
before
in
1804
at
the
time
of
the
establishment
of
the
empire
he
had
secretly
visited
the
famous
fortuneteller
mademoiselle
lenormand
who
had
told
him
that
he
also
should
be
a
king
and
reign
but
his
kingdom
would
be
across
the
sea
his
boundless
ambition
stimulated
by
southern
superstition
had
fed
itself
on
this
prophecy
even
when
the
breach
with
napoleon
seemed
to
close
the
door
to
all
hope

in
may
1809
a
revolution
in
sweden
had
deposed
the
incapable
gustavus
iv
and
set
up
as
king
his
uncle
charles
duke
of
sudermania
the
new
king
charles
xiii
was
old
and
childless
accordingly
the
question
of
the
succession
filled
all
mens
minds
with
russia
pressing
in
on
the
east
and
denmark
hostile
on
the
west
it
was
important
to
find
some
one
round
whom
all
might
rally
by
preference
a
soldier
it
was
of
course
obvious
that
france
the
traditional
ally
of
sweden
dominated
europe
accordingly
the
swedes
determined
to
seek
their
crown
prince
from
the
hands
of
napoleon
now
of
all
the
marshals
bernadotte
had
had
most
to
do
with
the
swedes
at
hamburg
he
had
had
constant
questions
to
settle
with
the
pomeranians
at
the
time
of
blüchers
surrender
at
lübeck
he
had
treated
with
great
courtesy
certain
swedish
prisoners
it
seemed
therefore
to
the
swedish
kings
advisers
that
the
prince
of
ponte
corvo
the
brotherinlaw
of
king
joseph
the
hero
of
austerlitz
was
the
most
suitable
candidate
they
could
find
napoleon
however
was
furious
when
he
heard
that
a
deputation
had
arrived
to
offer
the
position
of
crown
prince
of
sweden
to
bernadotte
too
diplomatic
to
refuse
to
allow
the
offer
to
be
made
he
set
to
work
at
once
secretly
to
undermine
the
marshals
popularity
in
sweden
and
while
pretending
to
leave
the
decision
to
bernadotte
himself
assured
his
friends
that
the
marshal
would
never
dare
to
accept
the
responsibility
but
napoleon
had
miscalculated
some
kind
friend
informed
the
marshal
of
what
the
emperor
had
said
and
as
bernadotte
himself
admitted
it
was
the
taunt
he
will
never
dare
which
decided
him
to
accept
the
swedish
offer
before
the
crown
prince
elect
quitted
france
the
emperor
attempted
to
place
on
him
the
condition
that
he
should
never
bear
arms
against
him
but
bernadotte
foreseeing
the
future
refused
to
give
any
such
promise
and
at
last
the
emperor
gave
in
with
the
angry
words
go
our
destinies
will
soon
be
accomplished

the
crown
prince
took
with
him
to
sweden
his
eldest
son
who
had
curiously
by
the
whim
of
his
godfather
napoleon
been
named
oscar
but
his
wife
désiré
could
not
tear
herself
away
from
paris
where
she
had
collected
a
coterie
of
artists
and
writers
her
salon
was
greatly
frequented
by
restless
intriguers
like
talleyrand
and
fouché
woman
of
pleasure
as
she
was
the
gaiety
of
paris
was
the
breath
of
her
nostrils
accordingly
the
crown
princess
remained
behind
as
it
were
the
hostage
for
the
princes
good
behaviour
but
in
reality
a
spy
and
secret
purveyor
of
news
hostile
to
napoleon

on
landing
in
sweden
the
crown
prince
took
all
by
storm
his
good
looks
his
affability
his
great
prestige
and
his
apparent
love
for
his
new
country
created
an
enthusiasm
almost
beyond
belief
but
while
everything
seemed
so
favourable
the
crafty
gascon
from
the
first
foresaw
the
dangers
which
beset
his
path
napoleon
hated
him
russia
looked
on
him
with
distrust
and
desired
to
absorb
sweden
england
and
the
other
powers
mistrusted
him
as
the
tool
of
the
emperor
accordingly
the
moment
he
landed
at
gothenburg
the
prince
clearly
defined
the
line
he
intended
to
pursue
exclaiming
i
refuse
to
be
either
the
prefect
or
the
customhouse
officer
of
napoleon
this
decision
meant
a
complete
reversal
of
swedish
foreign
policy
and
a
breach
with
france
fortunately
for
bernadotte
the
old
king
charles
xiii
was
only
too
glad
to
leave
everything
to
his
adopted
son
since
it
was
impossible
to
make
a
complete
volte
face
in
a
moment
the
crown
prince
was
content
to
allow
the
swedes
to
taste
to
the
full
the
misery
of
trying
to
enforce
the
continental
system
for
he
knew
what
disastrous
effect
a
war
with
england
would
have
on
swedish
trade
and
he
foresaw
that
his
subjects
would
soon
be
glad
to
accept
any
policy
whereby
their
seaborne
commerce
might
be
saved
while
the
swedes
were
learning
the
folly
of
fighting
the
mistress
of
the
sea
the
crown
prince
had
time
to
make
his
plans
so
that
when
the
moment
arrived
he
might
step
forward
as
the
saviour
of
the
country
it
was
quite
clear
that
a
breach
with
france
must
mean
the
loss
of
pomerania
and
all
hope
of
regaining
the
lost
provinces
on
the
southern
shores
of
the
baltic
but
bernadotte
determined
to
find
in
norway
a
quid
pro
quo
for
pomerania
to
force
russia
the
hereditary
foe
of
sweden
to
make
her
hereditary
ally
denmark
grant
norway
to
sweden
would
be
a
masterstroke
of
diplomacy
while
an
alliance
with
russia
would
guarantee
the
swedish
frontiers
and
would
bring
peace
with
england
because
russia
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
with
the
continental
system
the
swedes
would
thus
gain
norway
and
recover
their
seaborne
trade
while
the
crown
prince
would
be
acknowledged
as
the
legitimate
heir
of
the
royal
house
of
vasa
and
no
longer
regarded
as
an
interloper
a
mere
puppet
of
napoleon

success
crowned
the
efforts
of
the
elated
gascon
the
czar
with
the
prospect
of
a
french
invasion
at
his
door
was
delighted
beyond
measure
to
find
in
sweden
an
ally
instead
of
a
foe
in
august
1812
he
invited
the
crown
prince
to
russia
and
the
treaty
of
åbö
was
signed
whereby
russia
promised
to
lend
her
aid
to
sweden
to
gain
norway
as
the
price
of
her
help
against
france
a
little
later
a
treaty
was
concluded
between
england
and
sweden
the
crown
prince
returned
from
åbö
full
of
relief
not
only
was
he
now
received
into
the
inner
circle
of
legitimate
sovereigns
but
the
czar
had
actually
volunteered
that
if
napoleon
fell
i
would
see
with
pleasure
the
destinies
of
france
in
your
hands
alexander
had
kindled
a
flame
which
never
died
as
long
as
bernadotte
lived
the
remainder
of
his
life
might
be
summed
up
as
an
effort
to
gain
the
crown
of
france
followed
by
a
period
of
vain
regrets
at
the
failure
of
his
hopes

on
returning
to
stockholm
the
crown
prince
found
himself
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
cosmopolitan
admirers
the
most
important
of
whom
was
madame
de
staël
who
regarded
him
as
the
one
man
who
could
restore
france
to
prosperity
his
flatterers
likened
him
to
henry
iv
and
harped
on
the
fact
that
he
also
came
from
béarn
but
in
france
men
cursed
the
traitorous
frenchman
who
was
going
to
turn
his
sword
against
his
country
and
his
name
was
expunged
from
the
list
of
the
marshals
and
from
the
rolls
of
the
senate
while
the
emperor
bitterly
regretted
that
he
had
not
sent
him
to
learn
swedish
at
vincennes
the
great
military
prison
when
in
accordance
with
his
treaty
obligations
early
in
1813
the
crown
prince
of
sweden
landed
at
stralsund
to
take
part
in
the
war
against
napoleon
his
position
was
a
difficult
one
the
one
object
of
the
allies
was
to
overthrow
napoleon
the
one
object
of
the
crown
prince
was
to
become
king
of
france
on
napoleons
fall
the
allies
therefore
had
to
beat
the
french
troops
but
the
crown
prince
would
ruin
his
hopes
if
french
soldiers
were
beaten
by
the
troops
under
his
command
it
was
clear
that
napoleon
could
only
be
overcome
by
the
closest
cooperation
of
all
the
allies
accordingly
the
czar
and
the
king
of
prussia
summoned
the
crown
prince
to
a
conference
at
trachenberg
in
silesia
and
did
their
best
to
gratify
his
pride
the
plan
of
campaign
was
then
arranged
and
the
prince
returned
to
command
the
allied
forces
in
northern
germany
at
st
helena
the
emperor
declared
that
it
was
bernadotte
who
showed
the
allies
how
to
win
by
avoiding
all
conflict
with
himself
and
defeating
the
marshals
in
detail
with
great
bitterness
he
added
he
gave
our
enemies
the
key
to
our
policy
the
tactics
of
our
armies
and
showed
them
the
way
to
the
sacred
soil
of
france
be
this
as
it
may
his
conduct
during
the
campaign
justified
the
suspicion
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
friend
and
foe
only
three
times
did
the
princes
army
come
in
contact
with
the
forces
of
the
emperor
at
grosbeeren
and
dennewitz
where
his
divisional
officers
fought
and
won
the
prince
kept
discreetly
in
the
rear
at
leipzig
he
held
back
so
long
that
the
french
army
very
nearly
escaped
it
was
the
taunt
of
his
chief
of
the
staff
do
you
know
that
the
soldiers
say
you
are
afraid
and
do
not
dare
to
advance
which
at
last
forced
him
into
battle
but
while
thus
he
offended
his
allies
he
gained
no
respect
from
his
former
countrymen
he
had
always
believed
that
his
presence
alone
was
sufficient
to
bring
over
the
french
troops
to
his
side
but
his
first
attempt
ought
to
have
shattered
this
delusion
at
stettin
during
the
armistice
he
entered
the
fortress
and
tried
to
seduce
the
governor
an
exjacobin
and
erstwhile
friend
as
he
left
the
town
a
cannon
was
fired
and
a
ball
whistled
past
his
ear
he
at
once
sent
a
flag
of
truce
to
demand
an
explanation
for
this
breach
of
the
etiquette
of
war
whereon
his
friend
the
exjacobin
replied
it
was
simply
a
police
affair
we
gave
the
signal
that
a
deserter
was
escaping
and
the
mainguard
fired
in
spite
of
this
warning
and
many
other
indications
bernadotte
failed
to
understand
how
completely
he
had
lost
his
influence
in
france
and
while
the
allies
were
advancing
on
paris
his
secret
agents
were
busy
especially
in
southern
france
trying
to
win
the
people
to
his
cause
keeping
well
in
the
rear
of
the
invading
armies
he
entirely
neglected
his
military
duties
and
passed
his
time
listening
to
the
reports
of
worthless
spies
the
result
of
his
intrigues
was
that
he
quite
lost
touch
with
the
trend
of
events
at
the
front
and
when
paris
fell
instead
of
being
on
the
spot
he
was
far
away
the
czar
long
disgusted
with
his
delays
no
longer
pressed
his
suit
and
finding
an
apparent
desire
for
a
bourbon
restoration
accepted
the
return
of
that
house
so
when
the
crown
prince
came
to
paris
he
found
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
his
best
bow
to
the
bourbons
and
slink
away
home
to
gain
what
comfort
he
could
in
the
conquest
of
norway
thus
once
again
was
sièyes
saying
proved
correct
he
is
a
blackbird
who
thinks
himself
an
eagle

on
his
return
home
his
swedish
subjects
gave
their
crown
prince
a
very
warm
welcome
they
knew
of
none
of
his
intrigues
or
tergiversations
they
only
saw
in
him
the
victorious
conqueror
of
napoleon
who
by
his
successful
campaigns
was
bringing
peace
and
prosperity
to
sweden
by
his
diplomacy
had
acquired
norway
and
by
his
clever
huckstering
had
gained
twenty
million
francs
for
ceding
to
france
the
isle
of
guadaloupe
of
which
sweden
had
never
taken
possession
and
another
twelve
millions
for
parting
with
the
lost
pomeranian
provinces
but
in
spite
of
his
popularity
at
home
the
crown
prince
had
much
to
make
him
anxious
abroad
at
the
congress
of
vienna
a
strong
party
backed
the
claims
of
the
deposed
gustavus
iv
and
it
was
only
the
generous
aid
of
the
czar
which
defeated
this
conspiracy
further
the
attitude
of
the
powers
clearly
showed
him
how
precarious
was
the
position
of
an
intruder
among
the
hereditary
rulers
of
europe
consequently
when
napoleon
returned
from
elba
the
prince
exclaimed
the
cause
of
the
bourbons
is
for
ever
lost
and
for
a
moment
thought
of
throwing
in
his
lot
with
the
emperor
but
the
sudden
defeat
of
murat
came
as
a
warning
and
he
hastened
to
offer
the
aid
of
twentysix
thousand
troops
to
the
allies
though
outwardly
in
accord
with
them
the
crown
prince
secretly
hoped
for
the
victory
of
napoleon
to
his
intimates
he
proclaimed
that
napoleon
was
the
first
captain
of
all
ages
the
greatest
human
being
who
had
ever
lived
superior
to
hannibal
to
cæsar
and
even
to
moses
whereat
the
crown
princess
who
had
at
last
rejoined
her
husband
in
sweden
replied
you
ought
to
exclude
moses
who
was
the
envoy
of
god
whereas
napoleon
is
the
envoy
of
the
devil

the
news
of
waterloo
once
again
drove
the
princes
ideas
into
their
old
current
surely
france
must
now
recognise
that
he
alone
could
save
her
but
the
second
restoration
dashed
his
hopes
to
the
ground
yet
hope
springs
eternal
in
the
human
breast
and
bernadotte
year
by
year
watched
the
trend
of
french
politics
with
an
anxious
eye
even
as
late
as
the
revolution
of
1830
he
still
thought
it
was
possible
that
france
might
call
him
to
be
her
ruler
and
he
never
lost
the
chance
of
doing
the
bourbons
an
illturn
in
spite
of
these
intrigues
save
for
an
appeal
lodged
in
1818
against
the
highhanded
conduct
of
the
quadruple
alliance
in
interfering
between
sweden
and
denmark
bernadottes
european
career
really
ended
with
the
fall
of
napoleon
as
charles
xiv
he
ascended
the
swedish
throne
on
february
18
1818
on
the
death
of
his
adoptive
father
as
king
he
pursued
the
same
policy
as
crown
prince
alliance
with
russia
his
internal
policy
was
based
on
the
principle
of
maintaining
his
dynasty
at
all
costs
with
this
object
in
sweden
he
ruled
more
or
less
as
a
benevolent
despot
consulting
his
states
general
as
little
as
possible
paying
the
greatest
attention
to
commerce
and
industry
and
opening
up
the
mines
and
waterways
of
the
country
in
norway
however
where
the
storthing
had
long
enjoyed
great
powers
he
ruled
as
a
liberal
constitutional
monarch
and
with
such
good
fortune
did
he
and
his
successors
pursue
their
policy
that
of
all
the
diplomatic
expedients
arranged
at
the
congress
of
vienna
the
cession
of
norway
to
sweden
stood
the
test
of
time
the
longest
and
it
was
not
till
1906
that
the
principle
of
nationality
was
at
last
enforced
in
scandinavia

though
charles
xiv
made
no
attempt
to
interfere
in
european
politics
the
princes
of
europe
could
never
shake
off
their
dislike
of
him
standing
as
he
did
as
the
one
survival
of
napoleons
system
when
the
time
came
for
his
son
oscar
to
seek
a
bride
the
swedish
proposals
were
met
with
scorn
in
denmark
and
prussia
and
even
in
mecklenburganhalt
and
hessecassel
as
the
austrian
envoy
at
the
swedish
court
whispered
to
his
english
colleague
all
europe
would
see
the
fall
of
these
people
here
without
regret
consequently
the
swedish
king
was
driven
to
seek
a
bride
for
his
son
from
napoleons
family
and
eventually
the
young
prince
married
the
daughter
of
eugène
beauharnais
the
old
exviceroy
of
italy
napoleons
stepson

charles
xiv
a
man
of
regrets
spent
the
remainder
of
his
life
buried
in
the
memories
of
the
past
he
seldom
got
up
till
late
in
the
day
dictating
his
letters
and
receiving
his
ministers
in
bed
when
he
was
dressed
he
spent
some
hours
going
over
his
private
affairs
and
revising
his
investments
for
he
feared
to
the
end
that
he
might
be
deprived
of
his
crown
in
the
evening
he
entertained
the
foreign
representatives
and
held
his
courts
after
which
he
passed
the
small
hours
of
the
night
with
his
particular
cronies
fighting
and
refighting
his
battles
and
proving
how
he
alone
could
have
saved
europe
from
the
misery
of
the
napoleonic
wars
he
died
on
march
3rd
1844
at
the
age
of
eighty
having
given
his
subjects
the
precious
boon
of
twentyfive
years
of
peace

in
spite
of
his
brilliant
career
bernadotte
must
ever
remain
one
of
the
most
pathetic
figures
in
history
he
stands
convicted
as
a
mere
opportunist
a
man
who
never
once
possessed
his
soul
in
peace
and
who
was
incapable
of
understanding
his
own
destiny
so
much
was
this
the
case
that
in
his
latter
days
the
old
jacobin
now
a
crowned
king
really
believed
he
was
speaking
the
truth
when
he
said
that
along
with
lafayette
he
was
the
only
public
man
save
the
count
of
artois
who
had
never
changed
since
1789
he
saw
no
inconsistency
between
the
declaration
of
his
youth
that
royalty
was
a
monster
which
must
be
mutilated
in
its
own
interest
and
his
speech
as
an
old
man
to
the
french
ambassador
if
i
were
king
of
france
with
an
army
of
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
men
i
would
put
my
tongue
out
at
your
chamber
of
deputies
he
was
gascon
to
the
backbone
and
his
tongue
too
often
betrayed
his
most
secret
and
his
most
transient
thoughts
for
the
moment
he
would
believe
and
declare
that
napoleon
was
not
beaten
by
mere
men

he
was
greater
than
all
of
us

the
greatest
captain
who
has
appeared
since
julius
cæsar
if
like
henry
iv
he
had
had
a
sully
he
would
have
governed
empires
then
thinking
of
himself
as
sully
he
would
gravely
add
bonaparte
was
the
greatest
soldier
of
our
age
but
i
surpassed
him
in
powers
of
organisation
of
observation
and
calculation
yet
with
it
all
he
had
many
of
the
qualities
which
go
to
make
a
man
great
his
personal
magnetism
was
irresistible
he
had
consummate
tact
a
keen
eye
for
intrigue
a
clear
vision
to
pierce
the
mazes
of
political
tangles
and
considerable
strength
of
purpose
backed
by
an
intensely
fiery
nature
frank
and
generous
he
inclined
naturally
to
a
liberal
policy
but
his
innate
selfishness
too
often
conquered
his
generous
principles
it
was
this
conflict
between
his
liberal
ideas
and
his
personal
interest
which
caused
that
fatal
hesitation
which
again
and
again
threatened
to
spoil
his
career
and
which
made
him
so
immensely
inferior
to
napoleon
to
gain
his
crown
he
willingly
threw
over
his
religion
and
became
a
lutheran
to
keep
his
crown
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
honour
as
a
swedish
monarch
he
thought
more
of
the
interests
of
his
dynasty
than
of
the
interests
of
his
subjects
but
he
was
far
too
wily
to
show
this
in
action
posing
as
a
patriot
king
and
boasting
of
his
love
for
his
adopted
country
he
ever
remained
at
heart
a
frenchman

when
in
1840
the
remains
of
the
great
emperor
were
transferred
to
paris
he
mournfully
exclaimed
to
his
representative
tell
them
that
i
who
was
once
a
marshal
of
france
am
now
only
a
king
of
sweden

of
all
the
marshals
of
napoleon
perhaps
none
is
better
known
to
englishmen
than
jean
de
dieu
soult
his
long
service
in
the
peninsula
ending
with
the
stern
fighting
in
the
pyrenees
and
the
valley
of
the
garonne
and
the
prominent
part
he
took
in
french
politics
during
the
years
of
the
orleanist
monarchy
made
his
name
a
household
word
in
england
the
son
of
a
small
notary
of
st
amand
a
littleknown
town
in
the
department
of
the
tarn
soult
was
possessed
of
all
the
fervour
of
the
south
and
the
cunning
and
tenacity
of
a
gascon
born
on
march
29
1769
he
early
distinguished
himself
by
his
precocity
and
his
quickness
of
perception
although
handicapped
by
a
clubfoot
he
determined
to
be
a
soldier
and
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
enlisted
in
the
royal
infantry
regiment
his
intelligence
marked
him
out
for
the
rank
of
sergeant
and
in
1791
he
was
sent
as
sublieutenant
and
drill
instructor
to
a
battalion
of
volunteers
of
the
haut
rhin
in
spite
of
his
lameness
and
his
slight
frame
the
young
sublieutenant
was
possessed
of
a
physique
capable
of
withstanding
the
greatest
fatigue
and
hardship
and
spurred
on
by
ambition
he
never
shirked
a
task
which
might
add
to
his
reputation
consequently
he
was
soon
chosen
captain
by
his
comrades
and
once
war
broke
out
he
speedily
rose
at
the
battle
of
kaiserslautern
the
storm
of
the
lines
of
weissenburg
and
the
siege
of
fort
louis
he
forced
himself
to
the
front
by
his
gallantry
and
his
rapid
coup
doeil
but
it
was
the
battle
of
fleurus
which
once
and
for
all
established
his
reputation
soult
was
by
then
colonel
and
chief
of
the
staff
to
general
lefèbvre
the
gallant
marceaus
battalions
were
hurled
back
in
rout
by
the
enemy
and
their
chief
in
agony
rushed
up
to
lefèbvre
crying
out
for
four
battalions
of
the
reserve
that
he
might
regain
the
ground
he
had
lost
give
them
to
me
he
exclaimed
or
i
will
blow
out
my
brains
soult
quietly
observed
that
he
would
thereby
only
the
more
endanger
his
troops
marceau
indignant
at
being
rebuked
by
a
young
staff
officer
roughly
asked
and
who
are

whoever
i

soult
i
am
calm
which
you
are
not
do
not
kill
yourself
but
lead
your
men
to
the
charge
and
you
shall
have
the
four
battalions
as
soon
as
we
can
spare
them
scarcely
had
he
uttered
these
words
than
the
austrians
fell
with
fury
on
lefèbvres
division
for
hours
the
issue
hung
in
the
balance
and
at
last
even
the
stubborn
lefèbvre
began
to
think
of
retreat
but
soult
calmly
casting
a
rapid
glance
over
the
field
called
out
if
i
am
not
mistaken
from
what
i
judge
of
the
enemys
second
line
the
austrians
are
preparing
to
retreat
a
few
moments
later
came
the
order
to
advance
from
jourdan
the
commanderinchief
and
thanks
to
soults
soundness
of
judgment
the
divisions
of
marceau
and
lefèbvre
were
charging
the
enemy
instead
of
fighting
a
rearguard
action
to
cover
a
rout
after
the
battle
the
generous
marceau
sought
out
soult
colonel
said
he
forgive
the
past
you
have
this
day
given
me
a
lesson
i
shall
never
forget
it
is
you
in
fact
who
have
gained
the
battle
soult
had
not
long
to
wait
for
his
reward
for
in
1794
he
was
promoted
general
of
brigade

during
the
campaign
of
1795
soult
was
entrusted
with
a
light
column
of
three
battalions
of
infantry
and
six
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
was
constantly
employed
as
an
advance
or
rear
guard
on
one
occasion
while
covering
the
retreat
at
herborn
his
small
force
was
surrounded
by
four
thousand
austrian
cavalry
summoned
to
surrender
he
indignantly
refused
and
forming
his
infantry
in
two
columns
with
the
cavalry
in
the
interval
between
them
during
five
hours
he
beat
off
repeated
charges
of
the
enemies
horse
and
fought
his
way
back
to
the
main
body
without
losing
a
single
gun
or
a
single
colour
ten
days
later
he
added
to
this
triumph
by
inflicting
the
loss
of
two
thousand
men
on
the
enemy
in
the
mountain
combat
at
ratte
eig
when
both
sides
struggled
to
gain
the
heights
kneedeep
in
snow
during
the
campaigns
of
1796
and
1797
soult
increased
his
reputation
amid
the
marches
and
countermarches
and
battles
in
the
valleys
of
the
rhine
and
the
danube
but
it
was
in
switzerland
that
he
laid
most
firmly
the
foundation
of
his
future
success
for
there
he
gained
the
friendship
and
goodwill
of
masséna
and
it
was
the
conqueror
of
zurich
who
first
called
bonapartes
attention
to
the
sterling
qualities
of
the
future
duke
of
dalmatia
telling
the
first
consul
that
for
judgment
and
courage
soult
had
scarcely
a
superior
in
1800
masséna
took
his
trusty
subordinate
with
him
to
italy
as
lieutenantgeneral
of
the
centre
of
the
army
during
the
fierce
struggle
which
ended
in
the
austrians
driving
the
french
into
genoa
the
lieutenantgeneral
was
seen
at
his
best
exposing
his
person
in
a
way
he
seldom
did
later
and
showing
that
strategic
insight
and
power
of
organisation
for
which
he
was
so
celebrated
on
one
occasion
when
cornered
by
bellegarde
he
was
summoned
to
surrender
the
austrian
parlementaire
pointed
out
that
it
was
hopeless
to
continue
the
struggle
as
he
had
neither
provisions
nor
ammunition
to
this
soult
replied
with
bayonets
and
men
who
know
how
to
use
them
one
lacks
nothing
and
in
spite
of
every
effort
of
the
enemy
with
the
white
arm
alone
he
cut
his
way
into
genoa
during
the
siege
he
was
massénas
right
hand
ever
ready
with
shrewd
advice
the
soul
of
every
sortie
till
unluckily
he
was
wounded
at
the
combat
of
monte
cretto
and
captured
by
the
austrians
whose
prisoner
he
remained
till
after

soult
whose
politics
rested
solely
on
personal
ambition
and
not
on
principle
at
once
divined
the
aims
of
bonaparte
thanks
to
massénas
warm
introduction
and
his
own
reputation
he
found
himself
cordially
received
by
the
first
consul
honours
were
showered
upon
him
he
was
one
of
the
four
trusted
commandants
of
the
consular
guard
and
when
napoleon
began
to
organise
his
forces
for
the
struggle
with
england
he
entrusted
soult
with
the
command
of
the
important
army
corps
at
boulogne
the
first
consul
could
have
made
no
better
selection
under
his
rough
exterior
soult
hid
great
powers
of
business
a
keen
perspicacity
and
much
tact
quickwitted
with
a
subtle
restless
spirit
he
had
great
strength
of
character
and
his
ambition
spurred
him
on
to
a
diligence
which
knew
neither
mental
nor
physical
fatigue
but
in
spite
of
his
cold
air
and
selfrestraint
he
loved
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
was
passionately
fond
of
women
while
his
wife
exercised
a
complete
domination
over
him
and
before
her
he
quailed
like
a
child
in
war
he
had
the
keen
imagination
and
quick
penetration
of
a
great
strategist
his
special
forte
was
the
planning
of
vigorous
enterprises
but
he
preferred
to
direct
rather
than
to
lead
though
his
courage
was
undoubted
as
he
grew
older
he
was
chary
of
risking
his
person
and
had
not
the
dashing
qualities
of
lannes
and
ney
as
an
administrator
he
was
the
equal
of
davout
once
entrusted
with
the
command
of
the
army
corps
at
boulogne
the
young
general
of
thirtyfive
laid
aside
all
thoughts
of
personal
pleasure
and
ease
and
set
himself
to
manufacture
a
fighting
machine
which
should
be
the
most
perfect
of
its
time
never
was
such
attention
shown
to
details
of
administration
and
instruction
and
the
discipline
of
the
corps
at
boulogne
was
the
severest
that
french
troops
had
ever
undergone
as
might
be
expected
there
were
many
grumbles
and
soon
rumours
and
complaints
reached
the
first
consul
who
himself
remonstrated
with
his
lieutenant
telling
him
that
the
troops
would
sink
under
such
treatment
but
he
was
greeted
with
the
reply
such
as
cannot
withstand
the
fatigue
which
i
myself
undergo
will
remain
at
the
depôts
but
those
who
do
stand
it
will
be
fit
to
undertake
the
conquest
of
the
world
soult
was
right
in
his
estimate
for
in
spite
of
the
demands
he
made
on
their
endurance
he
had
won
their
love
and
admiration
the
weak
and
the
grumblers
fell
out
and
when
war
was
declared
his
corps
marched
to
the
front
a
body
of
picked
men
with
absolute
confidence
in
their
leader
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
never
held
an
independent
command
there
was
no
surprise
when
he
was
included
among
the
number
of
the
marshals
for
his
brilliant
record
his
selection
as
commandant
of
the
guard
his
success
at
boulogne
and
the
favour
which
the
first
consul
had
long
shown
to
him
had
marked
him
out
as
one
of
the
coming
men
the
campaign
of
1805
bore
witness
to
the
justness
of
the
emperors
choice
it
has
often
been
said
and
indeed
wellington
himself
lent
credit
to
the
dictum
that
soult
was
primarily
a
strategist
and
no
tactician
but
at
austerlitz
he
showed
that
calm
capacity
to
read
the
signs
of
the
conflict
and
that
knowledge
of
when
and
where
to
strike
which
had
first
brought
him
to
the
front
in
the
days
of
fleurus
entrusted
with
the
command
of
the
centre
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
his
subordinates
and
even
the
commands
of
the
emperor
he
refused
to
open
his
attack
until
he
saw
that
the
russian
left
was
hopelessly
compromised
thanks
to
his
clearness
of
foresight
when
once
he
launched
his
attack
he
not
only
put
the
issue
out
of
doubt
but
completely
overwhelmed
the
russians
their
left
was
surrounded
and
annihilated
while
the
centre
and
right
were
driven
from
the
field
in
complete
rout
at
the
moment
when
the
marshal
was
directing
the
movement
which
wrested
from
the
enemy
the
key
of
the
position
napoleon
and
his
staff
arrived
on
the
scene
the
marshal
explained
his
manoeuvre
and
asked
the
emperor
for
orders
carry
on
carry
on
my
dear
marshal
said
the
emperor
you
know
quite
as
well
as
i
do
how
to
finish
the
affair
then
stretching
out
his
arms
to
embrace
him
he
cried
out
my
dear
marshal
you
are
the
finest
tactician
in
europe
after
the
treaty
of
pressburg
soults
corps
remained
as
part
of
the
army
of
occupation
in
the
valley
of
the
danube
and
in
1806
formed
one
of
the
corps
of
the
grand
army
during
the
prussian
war
at
jena
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
playing
an
important
part
in
the
battle
for
when
neys
rash
advance
had
compromised
the
situation
it
was
he
who
checked
the
victorious
rush
of
the
enemy
but
later
the
marshal
had
bitter
cause
to
repent
these
triumphs
won
over
his
rival
already
the
enemy
of
berthier
and
consequently
often
misrepresented
to
the
emperor
soult
now
incurred
the
bitter
hatred
of
ney
and
what
the
enmity
of
berthier
and
ney
meant
he
found
to
his
cost
during
the
peninsular
war
immediately
after
jena
the
marshal
was
detached
in
pursuit
of
the
prussians
and
on
the
day
following

greussen
and
proceeded
to
blockade
magdeburg
from
magdeburg
he
hurried
off
to
join
in
the
pursuit
of
blücher
and
aided
by
bernadotte
he
cornered
the
crafty
old
prussian
at
lübeck
but
brilliant
as
his
performance
was
he
did
not
gain
the
credit
he
deserved
for
on
the
day
of
the
action
murat
arrived
and
took
over
the
command
arrogating
to
himself
all
the
honours
of
the
surrender
the
marshal
was
justly
indignant
but
bitterly
as
he
resented
the
injustice
he
was
too
politic
to
storm
at
the
emperor
like
marshal
lannes
in
the
terrible
campaign
in
poland
the
marshal
added
to
his
laurels
at
eylau
when
augereau
had
been
routed
davout
checked
and
ney
and
bernadotte
not
yet
arrived
on
the
field
it
was
he
who
warned
the
emperor
against
showing
any
signs
of
retreat
beware
of
doing
so
sire
he
exclaimed
let
us
remain
the
last
on
the
field
and
we
shall
have
the
honour
of
the
day
from
what
i
have
seen
i
expect
the
enemy
will
retreat
in
the
night
the
advice
was
sound
and
the
marshal
during
the
night
following
the
battle
had
the
pleasure
of
being
the
first
to
perceive
that
the
enemy
was
retreating
and
it
was
his
aidedecamp
who
carried
the
news
to
headquarters
well
it
was
for
the
emperor
that
he
accepted
soults
advice
for
the
terrible
carnage
in
the
snow
had
taken
the
heart
out
of
the
troops
and
a
retreat
would
have
soon
degenerated
into
a
rout
so
shaken
was
the
french
morale
that
when
on
the
next
day
the
emperor
rode
down
the
lines
instead
of
being
greeted
with
cries
of
long
live
the
emperor
he
was
received
with
murmurs
of
peace
and
france
and
even
peace
and
bread
during
the
final
advance
soult
had
his
share
of
the
hard
fighting
at
heilsberg
but
he
escaped
from
the
horrors
of
friedland
as
he
had
been
detached
to
occupy
königsberg
after
the
peace
of
tilsit
the
marshals
corps
was
cantonned
round
stettin
and
it
was
there
that
in
1808
he
received
the
title
of
duke
of
dalmatia
the
selection
of
this
name
caused
the
duke
much
annoyance
for
instead
of
receiving
a
title
which
should
recall
one
of
his
great
exploits
as
had
ney
davout
lannes
kellermann
and
masséna
his
designation
was
chosen
from
a
country
with
which
he
had
not
the
smallest
connection
and
thus
he
found
himself
on
a
par
with
bessières
maret
and
caulaincourt
what
he
hankered
after
was
the
title
of
duke
of
austerlitz
but
the
emperor
refused
to
share
the
glories
of
that
day
in
spite
of
the
huge
dotation
he
received
the
marshal
added
this
supposed
slight
to
the
many
grudges
he
bore
his
master

from
stettin
the
duke
of
dalmatia
was
summoned
in
september
1808
to
attend
the
conference
at
erfurt
and
from
there
he
was
hurriedly
despatched
to
spain
the
emperor
was
much
displeased
with
many
of
his
corps
commanders
and
so
on
the
arrival
of
the
duke
he
ordered
him
to
take
over
from
marshal
bessières
the
command
of
the
second
corps
soult
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
service
full
of
zeal
he
set
out
for
his
new
command
and
pushing
on
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
he
arrived
at
his
headquarters
alone
on
a
jaded
posthorse
twentyfour
hours
before
his
aidesdecamp
a
few
days
later
he
dashed
to
pieces
the
semblance
of
a
spanish
army
at
gamoral
and
occupied
burgos
where
he
was
unable
to
prevent
his
new
command
from
sacking
the
town
and
inflicting
every
possible
horror
on
the
inhabitants
from
burgos
the
emperor
despatched
him
to
the
northwest
and
thus
it
was
that
the
cavalry
of
sir
john
moores
army
surprised
soults
outpost
at
sahagun
the
emperor
could
scarcely
believe
that
an
english
army
had
actually
dared
to
advance
against
his
troops
but
he
at
once
ordered
soult
to
cooperate
with
the
divisions
he
led
in
person
from
madrid
and
when
he
found
that
the
english
were
bound
to
escape
he
handed
over
the
command
to
the
marshal
the
french
suffered
almost
as
much
as
the
english
in
the
terrible
pursuit
and
it
was
the
tried
soldiers
of
both
armies
who
at
last
met
face
to
face
at
corunna
after
the
battle
soult
wrote
to
the
emperor
that
without
fresh
reinforcements
he
could
effect
nothing
against
the
english
but
when
later
he
found
that
the
enemy
had
evacuated
corunna
he
claimed
that
he
had
won
a
victory
with
a
generosity
that
must
be
placed
to
his
credit
he
took
great
care
of
the
grave
of
his
adversary
sir
john
moore
and
erected
a
monument
with
the
inscription
hic
cecidit
johannes
moore
dux
exercitus
britannici
in
pugna
januarii
xvi
1809
contra
gallos
a
duce
dalmatiæ
ductos

before
leaving
for
france
the
emperor
had
drawn
up
a
cut
and
dried
plan
for
the
systematic
conquest
of
the
whole
peninsula
the
pivot
of
the
whole
scheme
rested
on
the
supposed
ability
of
soult
to
overrun
portugal
and
drive
the
british
out
of
lisbon
by
february
16
1809
unfortunately
napoleon
left
one
factor
out
of
his
calculations
and
that
the
most
important
namely
the
feelings
of
the
spanish
and
portuguese
populations
the
duke
of
dalmatia
very
soon
perceived
the
emperors
mistake
but
anxious
not
to
be
accused
of
shirking
his
task
and
of
allowing
himself
to
be
stopped
by
what
were
termed
bands
of
illarmed
peasants
he
started
on
his
expedition
to
conquer
the
kingdom
of
portugal
with
but
three
thousand
rounds
for
his
guns
and
five
hundred
thousand
cartridges
for
his
infantry
carried
on
the
backs
of
mules
for
owing
to
the
state
of
the
roads
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
peninsula
wheel
traffic
was
impossible
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
of
transport
and
the
murmurs
of
many
of
his
officers
the
indefatigable
marshal
hurled
all
obstacles
aside
and
with
sixteen
thousand
troops
forced
his
way
into
oporto
on
march
29th
six
weeks
behind
his
scheduled
time
but
there
he
had
to
call
a
halt
for
he
had
not
the
men
nor
the
material
for
a
further
advance
on
lisbon
the
situation
was
by
no
means
reassuring
to
reach
oporto
he
had
been
obliged
to
cut
himself
adrift
from
his
base
and
he
had
no
tidings
of
what
was
happening
in
the
rest
of
the
peninsula
during
april
he
set
himself
to
conciliate
the
people
of
portugal
and
at
the
same
time
to
try
and
get
into
touch
with
the
other
french
corps
in
spain
the
marshals
attempt
at
conciliation
was
on
the
whole
successful
but
his
kindness
resulted
in
an
unsuspected
turn
in
the
situation
a
movement
was
started
among
a
certain
section
of
the
portuguese
nobility
and
officials
to
offer
the
crown
of
portugal
to
the
marshal
the
duke
of
dalmatia
greedy
and
ambitious
but
ever
cautious
was
of
opinion
that
though
the
emperor
might
disapprove
of
the
idea
he
would
accept
a
fait
accompli
accordingly
he
secretly
sanctioned
the
movement
and
allowed
placards
to
appear
in
oporto
stating
that
the
prince
regent
by
his
departure
to
brazil
had
formally
resigned
the
crown
and
that
the
only
salvation
of
portugal
would
be
that
the
duke
of
dalmatia
the
most
distinguished
of
the
pupils
of
the
great
napoleon
should
ascend
the
vacant
throne
further
he
actually
on
april
19th
ordered
his
chief
of
the
staff
to
send
a
circular
to
commanding
officers
inviting
their
cooperation
in
his
seizure
of
the
crown
stating
that
by
so
doing
they
would
in
no
way
be
disloyal
to
the
emperor
luckily
for
the
marshal
the
arrival
of
sir
arthur
wellesley
and
the
english
army
before
the
plot
could
succeed
once
and
for
all
blew
aside
this
cloudy
attempt
at
kingship
for
the
emperor
on
hearing
of
the
affair
although
he
pardoned
the
marshal
saying
i
remember
nothing
but
austerlitz
still
wrote
in
the
same
despatch
that
it
would
have
been
a
crime
clear
lèse
majesté
an
attack
on
the
imperial
dignity
and
added
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
army
grew
discontented
since
the
marshal
was
working
not
for
france
but
for
himself
and
that
disobedience
to
the
marshals
orders
was
quite
justified
for
once
then
the
marshal
usually
so
clever
and
cautious
had
allowed
ambition
to
run
away
with
prudence
meanwhile
the
military
situation
grew
day
by
day
more
disquieting
in
the
french
army
there
was
a
section
of
the
officers
ready
to
declare
against
the
empire
whenever
a
chance
occurred
and
one
of
them
argenton
by
name
actually
entered
into
a
treasonable
negotiation
with
sir
arthur
wellesley
it
was
thanks
to
the
discovery
of
this
plot
that
the
marshal
first
got
information
of
his
enemies
projected
advance

with
thirty
thousand
english
marching
against
him
and
spanish
and
portuguese
forces
across
the
main
line
of
retreat
it
was
impossible
to
expect
to
hold
oporto
and
accordingly
the
marshal
began
preparations
for
withdrawal
but
having
secured
as
he
thought
all
the
boats
on
the
douro
he
concluded
that
he
could
only
be
attacked
by
a
force
ferried
across
at
the
river
mouth
by
the
boats
of
the
english
fleet
consequently
he
kept
no
watch
up
stream
so
complete
was
the
surprise
that
an
hour
after
the
enemy
had
effected
a
landing
above
the
town
the
marshal
who
had
been
up
all
night
was
still
in
bed
his
staff
were
quietly
breakfasting
when
an
officer
galloped
up
with
the
news
of
the
crossing
soult
could
do
nothing
else
but
give
the
order
to
retreat
by
whatever
means
possible
and
it
was
fortunate
for
the
french
that
the
pursuit
was
not
pushed
harder
but
once
he
had
grasped
the
situation
he
made
amends
for
his
previous
neglect
of
supervision
and
showed
himself
the
soult
of
austerlitz
and
eylau
sacrificing
his
baggage
his
guns
and
his
military
chest
guided
by
a
spanish
pedlar
he
made
a
most
astounding
march
through
the
rugged
region
of
tras
os
montes
crossing
lofty
passes
forcing
gorges
in
the
teeth
of
hostile
bands
of
peasantry
and
guerillas
by
hard
fighting
and
magnificent
marching
he
brought
his
troops
to
safety
the
campaign
of
oporto
did
not
add
to
the
marshals
reputation
his
political
ambition
was
the
cause
of
all
the
disaster
for
it
prevented
him
from
supervising
his
subordinates
operations
it
was
his
fault
that
there
was
no
proper
road
for
retreat
and
that
he
was
surprised
by
the
english
army
still
though
he
had
committed
great
faults
he
had
shown
a
surprising
ability
in
extricating
himself
from
their
consequences

when
soult
reached
lugo
in
spain
he
found
his
rival
ney
from
whom
he
begged
stores
and
equipments
and
with
whom
he
was
bound
to
confer
on
the
general
situation
ney
at
first
magnanimously
granted
the
marshals
requests
but
unfortunately
the
men
of
neys
corps
greeted
the
armed
rabble
which
followed
soults
standards
with
jeers
and
execrations
and
the
quarrel
spread
from
the
men
to
the
officers
and
at
last
to
the
marshals
so
fierce
were
neys
taunts
that
soult
actually
drew
his
sword
and
a
duel
was
with
difficulty
averted
thereafter
soult
while
promising
to
cooperate
with
ney
in
the
pacification
of
galicia
actually
did
nothing
and
seriously
compromised
his
rival
whereon
ney
refused
to
obey
any
orders
given
by
the
duke
of
dalmatia
such
was
the
situation
when
a
summons
from
madrid
called
the
two
marshals
to
the
succour
of
joseph
who
was
threatened
by
the
combined
armies
of
cuesta
and
sir
arthur
wellesley
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
the
marshals
arrived
in
time
to
save
madrid
but
not
in
time
to
surround
the
allies
who
escaped
south
across
the
tagus
and
the
one
chance
of
success
the
spanish
offered
them
was
lost
since
soult
eager
for
personal
aggrandisement
attacked
albuquerque
before
marshal
victor
had
time
to
arrive
on
the
scene
of
action
the
consequence
of
this
was
farreaching
for
victor
like
ney
refused
in
future
to
work
in
conjunction
with
soult
moreover
when
a
council
was
held
to
decide
on
the
next
operations
and
soult
wisely
no
doubt
insisted
that
at
lisbon
lay
the
key
to
the
situation
all
the
other
marshals
voted
against
his
scheme
as
each
one
determined
that
he
would
not
be
made
subordinate
to
the
duke
of
dalmatia
soult
accordingly
had
to
content
himself
with
occupying
the
valley
of
the
tagus
while
the
other
marshals
returned
to
the
districts
which
had
been
allotted
to
them
before
the
allied
advance
on
madrid

while
contemplating
this
unsatisfactory
situation
the
duke
of
dalmatia
was
rejoiced
to
receive
a
despatch
from
the
emperor
appointing
him
majorgeneral
of
the
forces
in
spain
in
place
of
jourdan
and
entrusting
him
with
the
invasion
of
andalusia
before
setting
out
for
the
south
soult
had
the
satisfaction
of
completely
routing
the
spaniards
at
ocaña
it
was
early
in
1810
that
he
entered
andalusia
and
seized
seville
granada
and
malaga
the
marshal
found
himself
in
the
congenial
position
of
absolute
ruler
of
the
richest
provinces
of
spain
but
though
the
important
towns
fell
easily
and
with
them
the
accumulated
riches
of
centuries
the
people
remained
sullenly
hostile
and
bands
of
armed
peasantry
hung
ever
on
the
rear
and
flanks
of
the
french
columns
and
stragglers
and
despatchriders
were
found
by
the
roadside
with
their
throats
cut
to
meet
this
situation
at
the
emperors
orders
soult
issued
a
proclamation
setting
forth
that
whereas
joseph
bonaparte
was
king
of
spain
and
no
spanish
government
existed
all
spaniards
taken
in
arms
were
rebels
against
his
catholic
majesty
and
would
be
immediately
shot
the
cortes
from
cadiz
replied
by
at
once
issuing
a
counterproclamation
stating
that
for
every
spaniard
executed
and
for
every
house
burned
three
frenchmen
should
be
hung
still
in
spite
of
this
war
of
reprisals
the
french
gradually
tightened
their
grip
on
southern
spain
and
soon
cadiz
remained
the
only
important
fortress
still
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
marshal
found
it
was
impossible
to
take
this
important
position
by
storm
and
contented
himself
with
masking
it
by
a
strong
corps
under
marshal
victor
meanwhile
he
was
busily
engaged
in
organising
the
new
government
of
andalusia
and
so
successful
were
his
efforts
that
neither
the
spanish
government
at
cadiz
or
the
constant
incursions
of
spanish
and
british
armies
were
able
to
shake
his
hold
on
that
province
but
wise
and
successful
as
were
his
methods
the
glory
of
his
rule
was
darkened
by
his
harshness
and
greed
the
churches
and
convents
were
ruthlessly
despoiled
of
their
treasures
and
many
a
fine
murillo
and
velasquez
was
despatched
to
paris
to
decorate
his
salons

in
the
eyes
of
the
duke
of
dalmatia
andalusia
was
a
vast
reservoir
of
wealth
which
might
be
used
as
a
base
from
which
a
wellequipped
force
could
threaten
lisbon
the
real
focus
of
all
the
opposition
to
the
french
domination
of
the
peninsula
it
was
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
that
he
conciliated
the
municipal
authorities
strengthened
the
police
and
built
up
huge
reserve
magazines
by
a
system
of
imposts
so
carefully
arranged
that
they
should
not
unduly
press
on
the
spanish
population
but
unfortunately
for
the
dukes
schemes
they
ran
counter
to
those
of
king
joseph
for
the
marshal
determined
to
use
the
wealth
of
his
rich
provinces
for
the
special
object
of
an
attack
on
the
british
power
at
lisbon
but
joseph
desired
that
the
revenue
thus
acquired
should
be
sent
to
assist
him
to
maintain
his
kingly
state
soult
strong
in
his
position
as
majorgeneral
and
backed
by
the
emperors
approval
refused
to
listen
to
the
demands
of
the
king
and
there
began
a
struggle
which
did
more
than
anything
else
to
bring
about
the
fall
of
the
napoleonic
kingdom
of
spain
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
marshal
gradually
wore
down
the
guerillas
actually
raised
and
trained
large
bodies
of
spanish
troops
built
up
vast
magazines
and
arsenals
at
seville
exploited
the
lead
mines
at
linares
and
the
copper
mines
of
the
rio
tinto
established
foundries
for
military
accessories
and
fitted
out
privateers
the
jealousy
of
joseph
brought
the
marshals
great
schemes
to
nought

the
continual
and
vexatious
demands
of
the
king
acted
in
a
most
unfortunate
way
on
soults
character
for
this
stupid
opposition
so
irritated
his
hard
and
egotistical
nature
that
he
saw
in
every
scheme
not
planned
by
himself
a
desire
to
belittle
his
glory
unfortunately
for
his
own
reputation
and
the
success
of
the
french
arms
he
allowed
this
feeling
to
obscure
his
judgment
and
he
refused
to
give
more
than
a
halfhearted
cooperation
to
any
measures
not
actually
suggested
by
himself
thus
it
was
that
in
spite
of
the
commands
of
the
emperor
and
the
entreaties
of
joseph
he
refused
to
make
any
attempt
to
cooperate
with
masséna
in
his
advance
on
portugal
until
it
was
too
late
then
when
he
actually
did
advance
he
showed
all
his
old
energy
and
skill
for
in
fifty
days
he
mastered
four
fortresses
and
invested
a
fifth
he
captured
twenty
thousand
prisoners
and
killed
or
dispersed
ten
thousand
men
but
he
disregarded
the
main
objective
the
expulsion
of
the
english
from
lisbon
and
contented
himself
with
the
siege
of
badajoz
and
thus
while
winning
a
fortress
he
lost
a
kingdom
from
want
of
his
cooperation
masséna
was
forced
to
retreat
and
the
grip
of
the
english
on
the
peninsula
was
more
firmly
established
than
ever

badajoz
was
soon
to
prove
itself
a
place
of
ill
omen
for
soult
for
a
few
months
later
when
an
angloportuguese
army
under
beresford
laid
siege
to
it
he
was
forced
to
come
to
its
rescue
it
was
in
the
attempt
to
relieve
this
fortress
that
the
terrible
battle
of
albuera
was
fought
at
the
commencement
of
the
fight
the
marshal
by
a
masterly
manoeuvre
threw
himself
across
the
allied
right
flank
and
seized
the
hill
that
dominated
the
position
and
it
looked
as
if
the
allied
lines
were
bound
to
be
crumpled
up
but
a
brigade
of
english
infantry
stood
firm
amid
the
rout
and
with
measured
volleys
checked
the
victorious
advance
of
the
elated
french
soult
by
every
effort
of
voice
and
gesture
attempted
to
force
his
veterans
to
face
the
foe
but
in
vain
nothing
could
conquer
that
astounding
infantry
no
sudden
burst
of
undisciplined
valour
no
nervous
enthusiasm
weakened
the
stability
of
their
order
their
flashing
eyes
were
bent
on
the
dark
columns
in
their
front
their
measured
tread
shook
the
ground
their
dreadful
volleys
swept
away
the
head
of
every
formation
their
deafening
shouts
overpowered
the
discordant
cries
that
broke
from
all
parts
of
the
tumultuous
crowd
as
slowly
and
with
a
horrid
carnage
it
was
pushed
by
the
incessant
vigour
of
the
attack
to
the
farthest
edge
of
the
hill
in
vain
did
the
french
reserve
mix
with
the
struggling
multitude
to
sustain
the
fight
their
efforts
only
increased
the
immediate
confusion
and
the
mighty
mass
breaking
off
like
a
loosened
cliff
went
headlong
down
the
steep
the
rain
flowed
after
in
a
stream
discoloured
by
blood
and
eighteen
hundred
unwounded
men
the
remnant
of
six
thousand
unconquerable
british
soldiers
stood
triumphant
on
the
fatal
hill
thus
napier
describes
the
battle
of
albuera
so
nearly
a
magnificent
victory
for
the
french
turned
by
british
valour
into
a
defeat
but
it
was
not
only
the
valour
of
the
enemy
which
cost
soult
his
success
it
was
his
own
errors
the
commencement
of
the
attack
was
a
magnificent
conception
but
the
marshal
failed
to
understand
the
tactics
of
his
enemy
and
it
was
his
blind
attempt
to
crush
the
line
with
heavy
columns
which
allowed
the
english
musket
fire
to
annihilate
his
dense
masses
after
the
cessation
of
the
combat
he
committed
another
great
fault
though
his
attack
had
been
beaten
back
it
was
known
that
the
allies
had
suffered
much
more
severely
than
the
french
and
on
the
strength
of
this
he
claimed
a
signal
victory
but
instead
of
holding
his
ground
he
withdrew
a
day
later
whereas
if
he
had
shown
a
confident
front
beresford
would
have
been
bound
to
retire
and
badajoz
would
have
been
relieved
after
the
battle
of
albuera
soult
was
reinforced
by
the
army
of
portugal
under
marmont
but
discord
soon
broke
out
between
the
two
marshals
the
duke
of
dalmatia
maintaining
that
the
way
to
attack
lisbon
was
from
his
own
base
in
the
south
and
the
duke
of
ragusa
advocating
the
northern
route
after
lying
together
for
some
time
the
two
armies
separated
and
soult
moved
south
to
complete
his
operations
against
cadiz
and
gibraltar
it
was
while
the
marshal
was
thus
engaged
early
in
1812
that
the
duke
of
wellington
suddenly
captured
ciudad
rodrigo
and
badajoz
and
was
thus
able
after
defeating
marmont
at
salamanca
to
march
in
the
summer
on
madrid
soult
replied
to
josephs
summons
to
come
to
his
help
by
telling
him
that
his
best
policy
was
to
join
him
in
andalusia
and
make
a
counterstroke
at
lisbon
but
the
king
refused
to
listen
to
this
wise
advice
so
the
marshal
was
obliged
to
give
up
all
his
achievements
and
go
to
josephs
help
meanwhile
the
king
wrote
complaining
to
the
emperor
but
napoleon
replied
that
soult
was
the
only
military
head
in
spain
and
could
not
be
moved
but
after
more
bickering
early
in
1813
joseph
wrote
to
say
that
if
the
marshal
remained
in
spain
he
himself
must
leave
the
country
and
the
emperor
anxious
to
regain
his
military
prestige
so
weakened
by
the
russian
campaign
was
glad
to
summon
the
duke
of
dalmatia
to
the
grand
army
but
soults
gloomy
prophecy
was
soon
fulfilled
that
the
loss
of
andalusia
and
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
cadiz
are
events
that
will
be
felt
throughout
the
whole
of
europe
the
marshals
service
at
the
head
of
the
imperial
guard
was
terminated
by
the
news
of
the
fatal
battle
of
vittoria
for
the
emperor
immediately
hurried
him
back
to
try
to
prevent
the
english
from
forcing
the
barrier
of
the
pyrenees

the
duke
of
dalmatia
gladly
accepted
the
mission
in
spite
of
the
repugnance
of
the
duchess
who
hated
spain
where
as
she
said
nothing
is
got
but
blows
so
hearty
was
her
dislike
of
the
country
that
she
actually
went
to
the
emperor
saying
her
husband
was
too
shattered
in
health
for
the
task
but
she
met
with
a
stern
rebuff
madam
said
napoleon
recollect
i
am
not
your
husband
if
i
were
you
should
conduct
yourself
very
differently

the
campaign
of
the
pyrenees
bore
ample
testimony
to
the
wisdom
of
the
confidence
the
emperor
had
placed
in
the
power
of
his
lieutenant
with
marvellous
sagacity
soult
reorganised
the
scattered
relics
of
the
french
armies
and
within
ten
days
of
his
arrival
at
headquarters
he
was
ready
to
assume
the
offensive
and
actually
all
but
surprised
the
duke
of
wellington
at
sorauren
but
great
as
were
his
strategical
powers
and
his
methods
of
organisation
he
was
no
match
for
wellington
on
the
field
of
battle
and
step
by
step
he
was
forced
back
into
france
round
bayonne
he
showed
his
complete
mastery
of
the
art
of
war
by
the
admirable
way
he
used
his
command
of
the
inner
lines
always
to
oppose
the
enemys
attack
by
superior
force
then
when
retreat
was
inevitable
instead
of
falling
back
towards
paris
he
withdrew
south
thus
forcing
his
adversary
to
divide
up
his
army
for
the
english
had
to
detach
a
strong
division
to
cover
their
communications
at
bordeaux
during
the
retreat
again
and
again
soult
turned
at
bay
at
orthez
and
many
another
good
position
but
wellington
ever
outmanoeuvred
him
on
the
field
and
even
turned
him
out
of
the
seemingly
impregnable
position
of
toulouse
never
was
a
retreat
more
admirably
carried
out
every
opportunity
afforded
by
the
ground
every
advantage
of
position
was
seized
on
to
use
to
the
full
the
french
dash
in
the
attack
no
more
admirable
illustration
can
be
found
of
the
truth
that
the
essence
of
defence
lies
in
a
vigorous
local
offence
wellington
himself
bore
testimony
to
soults
virtues
maintaining
that
of
the
marshals
he
was
second
only
to
masséna

with
the
restoration
the
marshal
at
once
accepted
the
change
of
government
and
gave
his
adhesion
to
the
bourbons
his
general
reputation
and
the
high
place
he
held
in
the
opinion
of
wellington
and
others
caused
the
king
in
the
december
of
1814
to
appoint
him
minister
of
war
such
was
his
position
when
news
arrived
of
napoleons
landing
at
fréjus
the
duke
of
dalmatia
did
all
in
his
power
to
organise
resistance
to
the
emperors
advance
but
he
had
many
enemies
and
the
king
listening
to
their
advice
replaced
him
as
minister
by
clarke
duke
of
feltre
soult
then
retired
to
his
country
estate
at
villeneuvelétang
near
saint
cloud
on
his
arrival
at
paris
the
emperor
at
once
sent
for
him
but
at
first
he
refused
to
go
to
court
ultimately
finding
the
emperors
cause
in
the
ascendant
he
cast
aside
hesitation
and
threw
in
his
lot
with
him
it
has
been
said
that
the
duke
betrayed
the
bourbons
and
was
privy
to
the
emperors
return
but
this
is
a
calumny
napoleon
at
st
helena
said
soult
did
not
betray
louis
nor
was
he
privy
to
my
return
for
some
days
he
thought
that
i
was
mad
and
that
i
must
certainly
be
lost
notwithstanding
this
appearances
were
so
against
him
and
without
intending
it
his
acts
turned
out
to
be
so
favourable
to
my
project
that
were
i
on
his
jury
and
deprived
of
what
i
know
i
should
have
condemned
him
for
having
betrayed
louis
but
he
really
was
not
privy
to
it
the
emperor
joyfully
accepted
the
marshals
adherence
and
made
him
one
of
his
new
peers
and
when
war
was
imminent
on
the
advice
of
davout
he
created
him
majorgeneral
and
chief
of
the
staff
this
selection
was
unfortunate
good
strategist
and
organiser
he
was
not
the
man
the
emperor
required
berthier
who
had
not
half
his
military
ability
had
made
an
excellent
chief
of
the
staff
because
he
had
the
rare
quality
of
effacing
his
own
ideas
and
acting
simply
as
the
recorder
and
expander
of
those
of
napoleon
but
soult
was
accustomed
to
think
for
himself
and
his
mind
was
unable
to
attune
itself
to
the
mind
of
the
emperor
further
from
long
experience
berthier
was
accustomed
to
fill
up
gaps
in
the
emperors
orders
in
the
way
he
intended
but
soult
had
never
so
far
worked
in
close
cooperation
with
napoleon
and
after
years
of
independent
command
was
more
accustomed
to
give
orders
to
his
own
chief
of
the
staff
than
to
work
out
minutiæ
for
another
consequently
all
through
the
waterloo
campaign
the
staff
work
was
badly
done
orders
were
faultily
drafted
mistakes
were
made
in
their
despatch
and
the
emperor
was
constantly
bewailing
the
loss
of
that
brute
berthier
a
typical
example
of
the
friction
which
arose
between
the
emperor
and
his
new
majorgeneral
occurred
when
at
waterloo
napoleon
asked
soult
if
he
had
sent
to
grouchy
intelligence
of
the
approach
of
the
prussians
the
marshal
replied
yes
i
have
sent
an
officer
one
officer
cried
napoleon
ah
if
only
my
poor
berthier
had
been
here
he
would
have
sent
six
to
add
to
these
troubles
soult
was
unfortunately
hated
by
the
officers
of
the
army
who
regarded
him
with
grave
suspicion
but
though
the
marshal
must
bear
his
share
in
the
disaster
of
waterloo
it
is
only
fair
to
add
that
the
morning
of
the
battle
he
and
he
alone
warned
the
emperor
of
the
magnitude
of
the
coming
struggle
and
entreated
him
to
recall
at
least
a
portion
of
grouchys
command
the
emperor
roughly
rejected
his
advice
with
the
words
you
think
that
because
wellington
defeated
you
he
must
be
a
great
general
i
tell
you
that
he
is
a
bad
general
that
the
english
are
bad
troops
and
that
this
will
be
the
affair
of
a
déjeuner
the
marshal
with
the
memory
of
many
a
battle
with
these
poor
troops
from
oporto
to
toulouse
could
only
sorrowfully
say
i
hope
so

on
the
second
restoration
the
duke
of
dalmatia
found
himself
included
among
the
proscribed
and
for
three
years
he
retired
to
the
duchy
of
berg
the
home
of
his
wife
during
which
time
he
occupied
himself
in
the
composition
of
his
memoirs
but
in
may
1819
he
was
recalled
to
france
and
soon
found
means
of
ingratiating
himself
with
the
bourbons
in
january
1820
his
marshals
bâton
and
his
other
honours
were
restored
to
him
and
he
entered
the
field
of
politics
with
his
vast
income
acquired
from
the
spoils
of
nearly
every
country
in
europe
he
maintained
his
high
rank
in
lordly
fashion
a
visitor
who
in
1822
went
to
see
his
famous
collection
of
pictures
thus
describes
him
we
were
received
by
the
marshal
a
middlesized
though
somewhat
corpulent
personage
of
from
fifty
to
sixty
years
of
age
whose
dark
curling
hair
rendered
somewhat
conspicuous
the
bald
patch
in
the
middle
of
his
head
while
his
sunburnt
complexion
accorded
well
with
his
dark
intelligent
eye
his
plain
stock
plain
dark
coat
and
loose
blue
trousers
which
capacious
as
they
were
could
not
hide
his
bowlegged
form
obviously
suggested
the
soldier
rather
than
the
courtier
the
marshal
rather
than
the
duke
though
if
i
had
encountered
such
a
figure
in
london
i
should
rather
have
guessed
him
an
honest
east
or
west
indian
captain
the
marshal
knew
well
how
to
win
favour
with
the
new
government
and
when
the
reactionaries
attempted
to
restore
the
ancient
position
of
the
church
no
one
was
more
regular
in
his
attendance
at
church
festivals
and
processions
than
the
duke
of
dalmatia
who
always
appeared
with
an
enormous
breviary
carried
before
him
though
people
were
unkind
enough
to
say
that
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
if
he
restored
some
of
the
vast
plunder
of
the
churches
and
monasteries
of
spain

with
the
fall
of
the
bourbon
dynasty
in
1830
the
subtle
old
soldier
at
once
gave
his
adherence
to
the
orleanists
and
was
appointed
minister
of
war
and
it
was
thanks
to
his
energy
and
wisdom
that
the
numerous
revolts
which
threatened
the
early
days
of
the
new
régime
were
stamped
out
soult
like
wellington
hated
the
idea
of
civil
war
but
knew
that
strong
measures
were
the
best
means
to
prevent
bloodshed
so
when
as
at
lyons
it
was
essential
to
strike
he
took
good
care
to
have
the
necessary
force
at
hand
a
year
later
when
the
commune
threatened
to
raise
its
head
in
paris
he
overawed
the
mob
by
the
sudden
mobilisation
of
eighty
thousand
troops
the
weakness
of
the
government
and
the
courage
and
decision
the
marshal
showed
during
the
émeute
caused
louis
philippe
on
october
18
1832
to
entrust
him
with
the
headship
of
the
administration
the
marshal
proved
how
often
a
strong
soldier
may
be
a
weak
politician
and
in
1834
he
resigned
office
but
during
his
term
of
office
he
did
not
forget
the
needs
of
the
army
as
his
measures
for
recruiting
military
pensions
and
the
training
of
officers
prove
when
again
in
1839
paris
was
seething
with
discontent
the
king
sent
for
the
marshal
and
under
his
iron
hand
order
was
easily
reestablished
but
the
old
soldier
was
no
orator
and
was
listened
to
more
from
respect
for
his
character
than
the
cogency
of
his
arguments
and
when
the
crisis
was
passed
he
was
soon
glad
to
resign
his
appointment
and
though
always
taking
an
active
part
and
ever
ready
to
give
his
advice
to
his
sovereign
he
never
again
held
office
in
1838
the
duke
of
dalmatia
visited
london
as
representative
of
france
at
the
coronation
of
queen
victoria
and
once
again
met
his
old
opponent
the
duke
of
wellington
lady
salisbury
thus
describes
their
meeting
the
duke
and
soult
met
in
the
musicroom
at
the
queens
concert
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
and
shook
hands
soults
appearance
is
different
from
what
i
expected
he
is
a
gentlemanlike
old
man
with
rather
a
benevolent
cast
of
countenance
such
as
i
should
have
expected
in
william
penn
or
washington
tall
and
rather
stooping
the
top
of
the
head
bald
the
duke
though
the
lines
on
his
face
are
deeper
has
a
fresher
colour
and
a
brighter
eye

the
duke
of
dalmatia
clung
to
the
orleanist
dynasty
till
the
end
and
attended
the
last
council
held
by
louis
philippe
he
had
a
special
liking
for
the
citizen
monarch
who
reciprocated
this
affection
and
had
in
1847
reestablished
for
the
veteran
the
title
of
marshal
general
of
france
a
designation
held
previously
only
by
turenne
villars
and
saxe
with
the
fall
of
the
dynasty
he
appeared
no
more
in
public
and
at
last
on
november
26
1857
he
died
at
his
château
at
st
amand
in
his
eightysecond
year

soult
is
able
but
too
ambitious
thus
napoleon
appreciated
the
duke
of
dalmatia
when
discussing
the
characters
of
his
marshals
but
soult
was
possessed
of
a
crafty
caution
which
seldom
if
ever
allowed
his
ambition
to
hinder
the
success
his
ability
deserved
cold
and
calculating
by
nature
he
knew
exactly
where
to
draw
the
line
the
attempt
to
seize
the
throne
of
portugal
was
the
only
occasion
on
which
he
seemed
to
throw
caution
to
the
winds
and
those
who
knew
him
best
were
so
astounded
at
his
lack
of
circumspection
that
they
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
himself
approved
of
the
proclamations
which
appeared
in
oporto
the
hard
crafty
nature
of
the
marshal
was
responsible
for
his
many
enemies
among
the
officers
of
the
army
his
own
staff
never
loved
him
much
as
they
marvelled
at
his
indefatigable
industry
and
his
suppleness
of
mind
which
permitted
him
to
turn
with
ease
from
the
highest
political
and
strategic
problems
to
the
drudgery
of
administrative
details
and
bring
to
bear
on
all
questions
the
cold
hard
light
of
lucid
reasoning
he
could
attract
men
to
him
by
sheer
admiration
of
his
ability
but
he
could
make
no
real
friends
for
those
who
came
in
contact
with
him
soon
discovered
that
he
only
thought
of
what
he
could
make
out
of
them
and
then
that
he
would
drop
them
without
the
slightest
regret
sprung
from
the
lower
ranks
of
society
the
marshal
had
all
the
cunning
and
avarice
of
the
typical
bourgeois
and
though
he
had
the
capacity
to
overcome
his
want
of
education
he
had
not
the
power
to
eradicate
these
inherent
strains
of
character
though
not
so
rapacious
as
masséna
the
duke
of
dalmatia
never
withheld
his
hand
when
plunder
offered
itself
and
his
home
in
paris
was
decorated
with
magnificent
objects
of
art
filched
from
nearly
every
country
in
europe
but
though
he
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
taking
what
seized
his
fancy
he
sternly
repressed
marauding
on
the
part
of
his
officers
and
men
hence
it
was
that
like
suchet
he
was
able
to
subdue
the
provinces
committed
to
his
charge
and
win
the
respect
and
obedience
of
the
spaniards
his
methodical
mind
hated
the
idea
of
disorder
administration
came
to
him
as
natures
gift
under
his
rule
andalusia
gained
a
prosperity
she
had
never
before
known
but
we
must
remember
that
his
success
in
this
province
was
due
not
only
to
his
great
gift
of
administration
but
also
to
his
ambition
for
it
was
the
driving
power
of
selfinterest
which
supplied
the
energy
which
oiled
the
wheels
of
his
system
for
the
marshal
hoped
with
the
resources
of
andalusia
to
supply
the
material
and
means
to
drive
the
english
from
lisbon
without
the
cooperation
of
king
joseph
or
the
other
french
commanders
in
striking
contrast
to
the
aversion
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
his
own
fellowcountrymen
was
the
feeling
of
admiration
with
which
he
was
viewed
by
his
foes
and
notably
by
his
english
adversaries
in
the
peninsula
they
only
saw
the
results
of
his
great
versatility
and
resource
and
his
acts
of
courtesy
to
those
who
fell
into
his
power
while
the
discipline
he
maintained
among
his
troops
stood
in
striking
contrast
to
the
conduct
of
many
of
the
other
french
commanders
moreover
the
marshal
was
too
politic
to
be
cruel
and
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
his
proclamation
against
the
spaniards
was
really
the
work
of
the
emperor
that
this
was
the
case
was
borne
out
by
the
following
letter
written
by
berthier
at
napoleons
dictation
let
the
duke
of
dalmatia
know
that
i
learn
with
indignation
that
some
of
the
prisoners
taken
at
ocaña
have
been
released
and
their
arms
restored
to
them
when
i
witness
such
behaviour
i
ask
is
this
treason
or
imbecility
is
it
then
only
french
blood
that
is
to
flow
in
spain
without
regret
and
without
vengeance
as
a
soldier
the
marshal
stands
high
among
his
compeers
in
spite
of
his
defeats
at
oporto
albuera
and
toulouse
throughout
his
career
he
clearly
showed
that
he
had
the
essential
quality
of
a
great
commander
the
ability
to
see
and
the
capacity
to
perform
what
was
possible
with
the
material
at
hand
his
strategic
insight
was
great
he
had
a
magnificent
eye
for
country
and
the
power
of
calmly
surveying
a
field
of
battle
but
as
wellington
pointed
out
he
had
one
great
fault
for
though
he
knew
how
to
bring
his
troops
to
the
field
he
did
not
know
so
well
how
to
use
them
when
he
had
brought
them
up
thus
it
was
that
at
sorauren
after
he
had
surprised
wellington
and
upset
the
whole
of
the
english
strategic
plans
he
was
unable
to
win
the
battle
which
was
necessary
to
reap
the
harvest
of
his
labours
but
the
passage
of
the
pyrenees
the
operations
round
bayonne
and
the
retreat
on
toulouse
will
always
be
studied
as
examples
of
the
most
perfect
military
operations
of
their
type
they
show
to
the
full
the
secret
of
the
marshals
success
as
a
soldier
the
blending
of
ardour
with
method
and
dash
with
caution
as
a
politician
the
duke
of
dalmatia
met
with
little
success
his
methods
were
those
of
a
dictator
rather
than
those
of
a
statesman
when
the
hour
of
action
was
passed
he
invariably
showed
weakness
but
whatever
were
his
faults
it
must
be
laid
to
his
credit
that
throughout
the
reign
of
louis
philippe
he
lent
all
the
weight
of
his
great
name
and
reputation
to
the
maintenance
of
order
at
home
and
peace
abroad

jean
lannes
marshal
duke
of
montebello


jean
lannes
the
future
duke
of
montebello
was
born
on
april
10
1769
the
year
which
saw
the
birth
of
many
famous
soldiers
napoleon
wellington
ney
and
soult
he
was
the
fourth
son
of
a
peasant
proprietor
of
lectourne
a
little
town
on
the
slopes
of
the
pyrenees
his
family
had
long
been
settled
in
the
commune
of
omet
in
the
department
of
the
gironde
the
first
to
rise
to
any
sort
of
distinction
was
jeans
eldest
brother
who
showed
at
an
early
age
such
ability
that
the
episcopal
authorities
of
lectourne
educated
him
and
in
due
time
he
became
a
priest
it
was
to
his
brother
the
abbé
that
the
young
jean
owed
such
elements
of
learning
as
he
possessed
but
the
pressure
of
need
compelled
his
father
to
indenture
him
at
an
early
age
to
a
dyer
in
lectourne
the
young
apprentice
was
of
middle
height
very
well
built
amazingly
active
and
able
to
bear
the
utmost
fatigue
his
face
was
pleasant
and
expressive
his
eyes
small
and
keen
behind
those
eyes
lay
a
brain
of
extraordinary
activity
which
was
controlled
by
a
boundless
ambition
enthusiastic
and
passionate
lannes
spirit
could
brook
but
little
control
action
was
the
zest
of
his
life
administration
and
control
came
to
him
not
as
natures
gifts
but
as
the
result
of
his
great
common
sense
which
guided
his
ambition
along
the
paths
which
led
to
success
a
nature
which
could
not
endure
the
dullness
of
the
dyers
trade
in
lectourne
could
however
compel
the
young
soldier
during
the
severest
campaigns
to
give
up
part
of
his
nights
rest
to
study
and
to
the
expansion
of
his
knowledge
beyond
the
elements
of
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
all
the
learning
his
brother
the
abbé
had
had
time
to
impart
to
him
even
in
the
later
years
of
his
life
the
successful
marshal
strove
by
midnight
toil
to
educate
himself
up
to
the
position
his
military
talents
had
won
for
him

jean
lannes
had
already
had
a
taste
of
the
soldiers
life
before
the
outbreak
of
the
revolutionary
wars
but
his
uncontrollable
temper
had
brought
this
short
military
experience
to
an
abrupt
end
and
he
had
been
compelled
to
return
to
his
work
at
lectourne
after
being
wounded
in
a
duel
his
employer
had
greeted
his
return
with
the
words
there
is
not
the
price
of
a
drink
to
be
made
in
the
trade
return
to
the
army
you
may
perhaps
become
captain
but
jean
lannes
did
not
need
such
advice
to
drive
him
to
the
path
of
glory
in
june
1792
the
government
of
france
called
for
volunteers
to
resist
the
coming
invasion
of
the
duke
of
brunswicks
army
lannes
enlisted
in
the
second
battalion
of
the
volunteers
of
gers
and
was
at
once
elected
sublieutenant
by
his
fellowcitizens
this
promotion
he
owed
partly
to
his
former
military
experience
partly
to
his
personal
magnetism
and
partly
to
his
extreme
political
opinions

when
spain
declared
war
on
france
the
two
battalions
of
gers
were
sent
to
form
part
of
the
army
of
the
eastern
pyrenees
there
lannes
gained
his
first
practical
military
experience
both
armies
were
extremely
illled
illdisciplined
and
illequipped
consequently
there
was
a
great
deal
of
desultory
handtohand
fighting
in
which
the
young
sublieutenant
distinguished
himself
by
his
courage
and
talent
he
enjoyed
himself
hugely
fighting
all
day
and
dancing
all
night
when
he
could
spare
the
time
from
his
books
when
military
knowledge
was
almost
entirely
absent
in
the
army
promotion
came
quickly
to
those
who
distinguished
themselves
by
courage
and
zeal
on
september
25
1793
lannes
was
promoted
lieutenant
a
month
later
on
october
21st
he
was
made
captain
of
the
grenadier
company
two
months
later
on
christmas
day
at
the
express
desire
of
his
chief
general
davout
he
was
given
command
of
his
battalion
and
appointed
colonel
on
the
staff
and
acting
adjutantgeneral
this
distinction
he
gained
for
his
brilliant
conduct
at
villelongue
summoned
from
his
bed
in
hospital
to
command
the
advance
guard
of
five
hundred
men
he
moved
towards
the
main
redoubt
of
the
spanish
lines
and
refusing
to
be
bluffed
by
the
proposal
of
an
armistice
captured
the
redoubt
by
a
dashing
charge
after
the
action
he
once
again
retired
to
hospital
his
next
exploit
was
the
delicate
mission
entrusted
to
him
by
general
dugommier
of
releasing
a
great
number
of
french
émigrés
who
had
been
captured
in
battle
and
who
otherwise
would
have
fallen
victims
to
the
popular
fury
while
devoting
himself
to
his
military
duties
he
yet
found
time
to
fall
in
love
when
in
hospital
at
perpignan
at
the
end
of
1793
he
had
met
mademoiselle
méric
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
banker
of
that
town
the
friendship
very
soon
developed
into
an
ardent
passion
and
on
march
19
1795
the
young
couple
were
united
and
the
marriage
seemed
very
advantageous
for
the
young
soldier
of
fortune
who
was
barely
twentyfive

after
the
treaty
of
basle
the
battalions
of
gers
were
brigaded
with
the
old
53rd
regiment
dalsace
and
formed
part
of
the
troops
which
schérer
took
to
reinforce
the
army
of
italy
in
the
summer
of
1795
accordingly
lannes
had
the
good
fortune
to
take
part
in
the
battle
of
loano
and
once
again
greatly
distinguished
himself
and
was
specially
mentioned
in
despatches

but
during
the
winter
of
17956
his
successful
career
nearly
came
to
an
untimely
end
for
on
the
reorganisation
of
the
army
along
with
many
other
officers
he
was
placed
on
half
pay
fortunately
at
the
moment
he
was
retiring
dejected
to
france
bonaparte
assumed
command
of
the
army
of
italy
the
new
general
felt
he
could
ill
spare
a
capable
officer
like
lannes
and
consequently
he
retained
him
provisionally
the
young
colonel
immediately
justified
his
action
at
the
critical
moment
of
the
austrian
counterattack
at
dego
lannes
cleared
the
village
by
a
brisk
bayonet
charge
thereon
bonaparte
gave
him
command
of
two
battalions
of
grenadiers
and
one
of
carbineers
which
formed
part
of
his
permanent
advance
guard
under
general
dallemagne
from
this
time
onward
lannes
had
found
his
proper
rôle
as
nature
had
intended
marshal
ney
for
the
command
of
a
rear
guard
and
murat
for
the
command
of
cavalry
so
she
had
equipped
lannes
with
those
qualities
which
are
specially
required
by
the
commander
of
an
advance
guard
wiry
and
strong
he
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
tired
and
never
sparing
himself
he
never
spared
his
men
his
kind
and
cheery
disposition
and
his
personal
magnetism
carried
all
before
him
his
fiery
enthusiasm
swept
aside
all
difficulties
his
inventive
genius
ever
showed
him
the
way
to
surmount
all
obstacles
when
danger
was
most
pressing
lannes
was
there
the
first
to
head
the
charge
the
first
to
rally
the
discomfited
never
had
fortune
a
more
zealous
wooer
at
lodi
he
was
the
first
man
on
the
bridge
later
at
the
head
of
three
hundred
men
he
reestablished
order
in
lombardy
at
one
time
especially
attached
to
the
headquarter
staff
at
another
hurried
off
to
suppress
some
outbreak
in
the
rear
at
another
repelling
a
determined
sortie
from
mantua
more
and
more
day
by
day
he
made
himself
indispensable
to
his
young
chief
at
the
battle
of
bassano
of
the
five
flags
wrested
from
the
enemy
lannes
captured
two
with
his
own
hands
wounded
slightly
at
bassano
and
more
seriously
at
governolo
he
yet
managed
to
creep
out
of
hospital
in
time
to
take
his
place
beside
bonaparte
at
arcola
early
in
the
battle
he
received
two
flesh
wounds
and
had
to
retire
to
have
them
dressed
scarcely
were
they
bandaged
when
the
news
arrived
that
augereaus
division
had
received
a
severe
check
oblivious
of
his
wounds
he
leapt
on
his
horse
and
arrived
at
the
head
of
his
columns
in
time
to
see
augereau
and
bonaparte
flag
in
hand
vainly
attempting
to
rally
their
soldiers
only
to
be
swept
off
the
embankment
into
the
marsh
but
lannes
headed
his
grenadiers
and
charging
home
on
the
austrians
swept
them
back
to
the
bridgehead
receiving
in
the
charge
yet
another
wound

illustration
jean
lannes
duke
of
montebello
from
an
engraving
by
amédée
maulet

during
the
early
months
of
1797
he
commanded
a
column
at
bologna
and
was
present
at
the
capitulation
of
mantua
thereafter
he
commanded
the
advance
guard
of
victors
army
which
invaded
the
papal
states
in
front
of
ancona
he
met
with
a
characteristic
adventure
making
a
reconnaissance
with
two
or
three
officers
and
half
a
dozen
troopers
he
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
three
hundred
of
the
enemys
cavalry
their
commander
at
once
ordered
his
men
to
draw
their
swords
preparatory
to
a
charge
whereon
lannes
rode
up
to
him
and
told
him
to
order
his
men
to
return
their
swords
dismount
and
lead
their
horses
back
to
their
headquarters
the
officer
obeyed
by
sheer
force
of
character
lannes
thus
dominated
the
situation
and
saved
the
lives
of
himself
and
his
escort
after
the
preliminaries
of
peace
at
leoben
bonaparte
employed
him
on
several
confidential
missions
in
which
his
impetuosity
led
him
at
times
into
difficulties

heard
the
reply
that
lannes
made
to
you
he
is
hotheaded
but
a
good
fellow
and
brave
i
must
write
to
him
to
tell
him
to
be
more
civil
to
a
minister
of
the
republic

africa
has
often
proved
the
grave
of
great
military
reputations
napoleon
himself
only
escaped
the
usual
doom
by
deserting
his
army
and
suddenly
appearing
as
a
deus
ex
machina
in
the
stormy
field
of
politics
at
paris
but
though
so
fatal
to
those
in
supreme
command
africa
has
sometimes
been
the
school
from
which
the
young
officers
have
returned
with
enhanced
reputations
it
was
from
the
companions
who
had
stood
the
test
of
the
fiery
trial
in
egypt
and
syria
that
bonaparte
later
selected
his
most
trusted
marshals

on
may
19
1798
lannes
sailed
for
egypt
in
the
orient
as
an
unattached
general
of
brigade
on
the
headquarter
staff
for
his
successful
action
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
assaulting
columns
in
malta
he
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
a
brigade
in
klébers
division
he
took
part
in
the
capture
of
alexandria
the
march
on
cairo
and
the
battles
of
chebrass
and
the
pyramids
but
it
was
not
so
much
his
success
in
these
engagements
which
enhanced
his
worth
in
bonapartes
eyes
as
the
fact
that
lannes
alone
of
all
the
general
officers
in
egypt
did
not
share
in
the
grumbling
and
depression
which
threatened
to
cripple
the
army
after
its
arrival
at
cairo
soldiers
and
officers
alike
had
but
one
desireto
return
home
lannes
secretly
informed
bonaparte
of
the
plans
of
those
who
led
the
discontent
and
in
the
words
of
murat
sold
the
cocoanut
thus
he
gained
the
future
emperor
as
his
lifelong
friend
and
murat
as
his
lifelong
enemy
when
in
february
1799
bonaparte
started
for
syria
he
took
with
him
lannes
in
command
of
menous
division

when
bonaparte
found
that
his
military
reputation
was
likely
to
suffer
by
a
more
prolonged
stay
in
egypt
and
above
all
that
france
was
now
ready
to
accept
the
rule
of
a
dictator
he
deserted
his
army
in
egypt
leaving
kléber
whom
he
hated
in
command
he
took
with
him
his
most
trustworthy
officers
lannes
murat
marmont
andréossy
and
berthier
ordering
desaix
to
follow
the
return
to
france
so
longed
for
by
most
was
less
agreeable
to
lannes
while
in
hospital
after
the
battle
of
aboukir
he
had
heard
that
his
wife
had
given
birth
to
a
son
whose
father
he
could
not
be
consequently
one
of
his
first
acts
on
his
return
was
to
divorce
her
but
bonaparte
gave
him
little
time
to
bewail
his
misfortune
for
he
relied
on
him
with
berthier
murat
and
marmont
to
debauch
the
army
and
bring
it
over
to
his
side
berthiers
business
was
to
win
over
the
general
staff
murat
the
cavalry
marmont
the
artillery
and
lannes
the
infantry
shortly
after
the
coup
détat
general
lannes
was
appointed
commandant
and
inspector
of
the
consular
guard
in
preference
to
murat
but
this
was
a
hollow
victory
over
his
rival
for
when
after
the
marengo
campaign
these
lifelong
enemies
met
in
open
rivalry
for
the
hand
of
caroline
bonaparte
the
first
consuls
sister
murat
aided
by
josephine
became
the
accepted
suitor
and
lannes
had
to
submit
to
see
his
hated
rival
in
quick
succession
the
brotherinlaw
of
napoleon
a
prince
of
the
holy
roman
empire
the
crowned
king
of
naples
and
most
bitter
of
all
the
confidential
friend
of
his
idol

it
was
in
the
marengo
campaign
that
the
general
had
his
first
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
as
an
independent
commander
and
winning
the
renown
which
the
victory
of
montebello
inseparably
connects
with
his
name
when
bonaparte
made
his
famous
march
into
italy
with
the
army
of
the
reserve
he
appointed
lannes
to
command
the
advance
guard
the
whole
success
of
the
operations
depended
on
the
rapidity
with
which
they
were
carried
out
for
the
first
consul
in
his
endeavour
to
get
astride
the
austrian
line
of
communication
was
exposing
his
flank
to
the
enemy
and
the
french
army
if
beaten
had
no
other
line
of
retreat
save
the
terrible
defiles
of
the
alps
accordingly
napoleons
selection
of
lannes
to
command
the
advance
guard
is
the
highest
possible
testimony
to
his
military
ability
the
battle
of
montebello
was
lanness
first
independent
engagement
in
it
he
showed
his
genius
for
war
if
he
had
allowed
the
austrians
to
reoccupy
stradella
he
would
have
ruined
the
whole
of
napoleons
scheme
of
operations
but
though
his
force
was
only
a
third
of
the
enemys
he
remembered
the
advantage
that
comes
to
the
assailant
instead
of
waiting
in
an
entrenched
position
he
attacked
and
by
his
indomitable
courage
and
tenacity
and
his
tactical
ability
he
kept
the
enemy
pinned
to
his
entrenchments
until
the
arrival
of
fresh
troops
under
victor
enabled
him
to
pulverise
his
foe
the
battle
was
one
of
the
finest
of
the
campaign
the
bones
said
lannes
cracked
in
my
division
like
glass
in
a
hailstorm

at
marengo
lannes
had
to
reverse
his
usual
rôle
and
fight
a
rearguard
action
for
during
the
early
part
of
the
engagement
the
french
were
outnumbered
by
thirty
thousand
men
against
eighteen
thousand
and
yet
the
general
was
able
to
report
i
carried
out
my
retirement
by
successive
echelons
under
a
devastating
fire
of
artillery
amid
successive
charges
of
cavalry
i
had
not
a
single
gun
to
cover
my
retreat
and
yet
it
was
carried
out
in
perfect
order
the
soldier
who
in
the
hour
of
success
was
full
of
impetuosity
and
élan
in
the
hour
of
retreat
was
able
to
inspire
his
troops
with
stubborn
courage
and
unfailing
selfconfidence
which
did
much
to
secure
the
victory

after
marengo
came
a
period
of
peace
lannes
as
commander
of
the
consular
guard
had
his
headquarters
in
paris
and
owing
to
his
official
position
was
constantly
in
touch
with
bonaparte
but
necessary
as
he
was
in
war
time
his
companionship
during
peace
was
not
altogether
congenial
to
the
first
consul
and
as
time
went
on
it
became
almost
distasteful
although
happily
married
to
mademoiselle
louise
antoinette
guéheneuc
the
daughter
of
a
senator
he
felt
himself
aggrieved
that
bonaparte
had
not
supported
his
suit
with
caroline
and
was
extremely
jealous
of
many
of
the
first
consuls
friends
the
constant
bickering
between
lannes
and
murat
never
ceased
moreover
lannes
as
an
outandout
republican
treated
the
first
consul
in
a
frank
spirit
of
camaraderie
relying
on
his
services
at
arcola
and
montebello
this
bonaparte
not
unnaturally
resented
the
increased
ceremonial
of
the
court
and
the
prospect
of
the
concordat
were
abhorrent
to
the
stern
republicans
but
necessary
to
establish
the
divinity
which
should
at
least
seem
to
surround
a
throne
relations
became
so
strained
that
bonaparte
was
soon
glad
to
seize
on
any
excuse
to
dismiss
lannes
from
his
post
murat
and
his
tool
bessières
provided
him
with
a
plausible
reason
lannes
by
nature
happygolucky
and
no
financier
wishing
no
doubt
to
please
the
first
consul
spent
his
money
freely
in
lavish
entertainment
at
his
paris
house
and
equipped
the
guard
in
most
gorgeous
uniforms
to
meet
these
expenses
he
overdrew
his
account
with
the
military
authorities
by
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
francs
murat
hearing
of
this
from
bessières
brought
it
to
the
first
consuls
notice
bonaparte
at
once
summoned
lannes
rated
him
soundly
and
commanded
him
immediately
to
refund
the
money
murat
was
delighted
he
thought
that
his
enemy
was
certain
to
be
disgraced
in
his
difficulty
lannes
turned
to
his
old
friend
and
former
chief
augereau
who
at
once
lent
him
the
money
and
refused
to
take
any
security
but
although
he
was
thus
able
to
refund
the
money
bonaparte
dismissed
him
from
the
command
of
the
guard
still
remembering
his
war
service
and
thinking
that
he
might
be
useful
again
later
he
did
not
disgrace
him
utterly
but
at
the
end
of
1801
sent
him
as
ambassador
to
portugal

lanness
diplomatic
career
was
at
first
not
very
successful
english
influence
was
allpowerful
at
lisbon
and
the
new
envoy
had
not
the
talent
to
counteract
it
in
the
autumn
of
1802
thinking
himself
slighted
by
the
portuguese
authorities
without
consulting
talleyrand
he
suddenly
withdrew
from
lisbon
and
returned
to
france
but
at
orleans
he
received
an
angry
message
from
bonaparte
forbidding
him
to
return
to
paris
the
first
consul
meanwhile
addressed
peremptory
messages
to
the
court
of
lisbon
about
the
supposed
insult
offered
to
his
ambassador
thereon
the
portuguese
foreign
minister
apologised
and
lannes
returned
angry
as
bonaparte
was
at
the
moment
he
confessed
later
that
lannes
soldierly
impetuosity
had
served
the
cause
of
france
better
than
the
skilfulness
of
a
consummate
diplomat
for
from
this
time
onwards
french
influence
began
to
increase
at
lisbon
lannes
was
courted
by
the
minister
and
the
prince
regent
himself
stood
godfather
to
his
son
the
story
goes
that
after
the
ceremony
the
prince
regent
took
the
ambassador
into
a
salon
of
the
palace
where
the
diamonds
from
brazil
were
stored
and
then
gave
him
a
handful
saying
that
is
for
my
godson
then
a
second
handful
for
the
mother
and
a
third
for
himself
whatever
the
truth
of
the
story
the
fact
remains
that
lannes
returned
to
france
a
rich
man
able
not
only
to
repay
his
loan
to
augereau
but
to
indulge
in
fresh
extravagance

from
lisbon
the
ambassador
was
summoned
to
attend
the
coronation
of
the
emperor
and
to
take
his
place
among
the
marshals
but
he
was
not
yet
received
back
into
full
favour
by
the
emperor
and
had
to
return
to
his
embassy
at
lisbon
it
was
not
till
march
22
1805
that
he
was
recalled
to
france
to
command
the
right
wing
of
the
army
of
the
ocean
which
when
war
broke
out
between
austria
and
france
became
the
grand
army
the
fifth
corps
under
lannes
reached
the
rhine
at
kehl
on
september
25th
napoleons
scheme
of
operations
was
by
making
vigorous
demonstrations
in
the
direction
of
the
black
forest
to
persuade
the
austrians
that
he
was
advancing
in
force
in
that
direction
while
all
the
time
his
wings
were
sweeping
round
the
austrian
rear
and
cutting
their
line
of
communication
on
the
danube
in
the
direction
of
ratisbon
the
task
of
deceiving
the
austrians
was
performed
to
perfection
by
murat
with
the
reserve
cavalry
and
lanness
corps
immediately
after
macks
surrender
at
ulm
the
emperor
detached
lannes
and
murat
in
pursuit
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
who
had
successfully
broken
through
the
ring
of
french
troops
lanness
infantry
tramped
sturdily
behind
murats
cavalry
and
fighting
proceeded
day
and
night
the
soldiers
marched
thirteen
fourteen
and
fifteen
hours
a
day
and
captured
in
five
days
fifteen
thousand
men
with
eleven
colours
one
hundred
and
twentyeight
guns
and
six
hundred
limbers
and
provision
wagons

during
the
rapid
advance
down
the
danube
on
vienna
the
fifth
corps
continued
in
close
support
of
murats
cavalry
vienna
capitulated
and
the
marshals
pressed
on
to
seize
the
bridge
before
the
city
the
defence
of
the
bridge
had
been
entrusted
to
general
auersperg
with
seven
thousand
men
the
bridge
was
commanded
by
a
battery
of
artillery
and
the
engineers
were
preparing
to
blow
it
up
when
murat
lannes
and
bertrand
arrived
the
three
general
officers
quietly
walked
down
to
the
bridge
and
shouted
out
to
the
austrian
picquets
that
an
armistice
had
been
arranged
thereon
the
commander
of
the
picquet
proceeded
to
withdraw
his
men
and
sent
word
to
auersperg
meanwhile
the
three
officers
strolled
unconcernedly
across
while
a
considerable
way
behind
them
a
strong
body
of
lanness
infantry
followed
when
the
french
generals
reached
the
austrian
end
they
found
a
sergeant
of
engineers
actually
proceeding
to
fire
the
fuse
lannes
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
snatched
the
match
from
his
hand
telling
him
that
it
was
a
crime
to
blow
up
the
bridge
and
that
he
would
be
disgraced
if
he
did
such
a
thing
then
the
two
marshals
ran
up
to
the
officers
commanding
the
artillery
who
growing
restive
at
the
continual
advance
of
the
french
infantry
were
preparing
to
open
fire
meanwhile
auersperg
himself
arrived
and
the
marshals
told
him
the
same
tale
affirming
that
the
french
were
to
occupy
the
bridgehead
uncertain
like
his
subordinates
and
but
half
convinced
he
allowed
himself
to
be
bluffed
and
thus
napoleon
secured
without
dispute
the
crossing
of
the
danube
the
boldness
and
audacity
of
the
scheme
so
successfully
carried
out
by
murat
and
lannes
difficult
as
it
is
to
condone
from
a
moral
point
of
view
brings
out
with
great
clearness
the
audacity
sangfroid
and
resourcefulness
of
both
these
marshals

the
successful
crossing
of
the
danube
was
soon
followed
by
the
decisive
battle
of
austerlitz
the
battle
was
brought
on
by
napoleon
impressing
the
allies
with
the
idea
that
it
was
possible
to
slip
past
the
french
left
flank
and
surround
him
much
as
he
had
surrounded
mack
at
ulm
for
this
purpose
the
right
under
davout
was
drawn
back
and
concealed
by
skilful
use
of
the
ground
the
centre
under
soult
and
the
left
under
lannes
were
to
hold
their
ground
until
the
russian
left
was
absolutely
compromised
when
soult
was
to
push
forward
and
seizing
the
commanding
hill
of
pratzen
to
cut
the
russian
force
in
two
while
lannes
and
murat
were
to
fall
with
all
their
weight
on
the
isolated
russian
right
for
once
murat
and
lannes
laid
aside
their
jealousy
and
worked
hand
in
hand
and
the
success
of
the
french
left
was
due
to
the
perfect
combination
of
infantry
and
cavalry
of
the
russian
right
seven
thousand
five
hundred
were
made
prisoners
and
two
colours
and
twentyseven
pieces
of
artillery
were
captured
but
hardly
had
the
battle
ceased
when
bickerings
broke
out
again
and
lannes
thinking
napoleon
did
not
appreciate
him
sent
in
his
resignation
which
the
emperor
much
to
his
surprise
accepted

the
marshal
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
year
1806
in
retirement
at
his
native
town
of
lectourne
where
he
was
joyfully
received
by
his
erstwhile
neighbours
and
friends
he
was
always
popular
with
his
fellowcitizens
not
only
because
of
his
republican
ideas
and
his
unaffected
simplicity
but
because
he
never
forgot
those
who
at
any
time
had
befriended
hima
man
who
had
once
lent
him
a
thousand
francs
was
presented
with
a
beautiful
house
and
garden
the
old
soldier
who
had
carried
him
out
of
the
trenches
at
st
jean
dacre
was
established
as
a
local
postmaster
and
received
a
small
property
and
an
annuity
and
the
marshal
never
passed
the
house
without
going
in
taking
a
meal
with
him
and
making
presents
to
the
wife
and
children
on
one
occasion
lannes
was
attending
a
big
official
reception
at
auch
on
his
way
he
passed
a
peasant
whom
he
recognised
as
one
of
the
playfellows
of
his
boyhood
strongly
moved
the
marshal
when
he
arrived
at
the
prefecture
asked
the
prefect
if
he
might
invite
one
of
his
friends
to
the
luncheon
the
prefect
was
charmed
but
much
surprised
when
an
aidedecamp
returned
with
the
peasant
whom
lannes
embraced
placed
by
his
side
and
soon
set
at
ease

but
war
once
again
caused
the
emperor
to
summon
his
fiery
lieutenant
lannes
took
command
of
the
fifth
corps
on
october
5
1806
and
five
days
later
had
the
satisfaction
of
beating
a
strong
prussian
force
at
saalfeld
from
saalfeld
the
marshal
pushed
on
towards
jena
near
which
town
early
on
october
13th
his
scouts
came
in
contact
with
a
large
prussian
force
under
hohenlohe
his
small
force
was
in
considerable
danger
but
napoleon
at
once
hurried
up
all
possible
reinforcements
the
prussians
held
an
apparently
impregnable
position
on
the
landgrafenberg
a
precipitous
hill
which
commanded
the
town
but
during
the
night
a
local
pastor
pointed
out
to
the
french
a
track
which
led
up
to
the
summit
which
the
prussians
had
neglected
to
occupy
working
all
night
the
french
sappers
made
a
road
up
which
guns
could
be
hauled
by
hand
and
on
the
morning
of
the
14th
the
corps
of
lannes
augereau
and
the
guard
were
safely
drawn
up
on
the
plateau
of
the
landgrafenberg
while
ney
and
soult
continued
the
line
to
the
north
a
heavy
mist
overhung
the
field
of
battle
and
hohenlohe
was
confident
that
he
was
only
opposed
by
the
fifth
corps
and
his
surprise
was
immense
when
the
fog
lifted
and
he
found
himself
confronted
by
the
french
army
the
battle
commenced
by
lannes
seizing
the
village
of
vierzehn
heiligen
while
the
prussians
were
fully
occupied
in
attempting
to
hold
this
village
napoleon
threw
his
flanks
round
them
and
the
battle
ended
in
the
annihilation
of
hohenlohes
army
in
the
evening
napoleon
learned
that
on
the
same
day
davout
had
completely
defeated
the
main
prussian
army
at
auerstädt
thereon
he
sent
forward
his
various
corps
to
seize
all
the
important
fortresses
of
prussia
and
detailed
lannes
to
support
murat
in
pursuit
of
the
prussian
troops
under
hohenlohe
and
blücher
which
retreated
in
the
direction
of
the
oder
if
the
battle
of
jena
had
been
followed
by
peace
as
had
happened
after
austerlitz
in
the
previous
year
it
is
more
than
probable
that
once
again
lannes
would
have
thrown
up
his
command
for
when
the
bulletin
appeared
the
part
that
his
corps
had
taken
was
almost
entirely
neglected
the
marshals
letter
to
his
wife
showed
that
he
was
vexed
beyond
words
with
his
treatment
by
napoleon
and
he
started
out
in
the
worst
of
tempers
to
support
murat
but
he
was
too
keen
a
soldier
to
let
his
personal
grievances
interfere
with
his
active
work
and
although
he
gave
vent
to
his
spleen
in
the
usual
recriminations
he
performed
his
work
to
admiration
so
hard
did
he
push
his
infantry
marching
sixty
miles
in
fortyeight
hours
that
he
was
never
more
than
five
miles
behind
the
light
cavalry
and
it
was
owing
to
his
effective
support
that
on
october
28th
murat
was
able
to
surround
hohenlohe
and
force
him
to
surrender
at
prinzlow
but
in
spite
of
this
murat
in
his
despatch
never
mentioned
the
name
of
lannes
it
took
all
napoleons
tact
to
smooth
the
marshals
ruffled
temper
and
it
was
only
the
prospect
of
further
action
which
ultimately
prevented
him
from
throwing
up
his
command
in
high
dudgeon

by
the
beginning
of
november
the
theatre
of
war
was
virtually
transferred
from
prussia
to
poland
as
after
ulm
so
after
jena
the
russians
appeared
on
the
scene
too
late
to
give
effective
aid
to
their
allies
but
in
sufficient
time
to
prevent
the
war
from
ending
napoleon
who
always
had
an
intense
esteem
for
the
marshals
common
sense
and
military
ability
asked
him
at
this
time
to
furnish
a
confidential
report
on
the
possibilities
of
poland
as
a
theatre
of
war
and
the
marshal
with
his
keen
insight
into
character
replied
i
am
convinced
that
if
you
attempt
to
make
the
poles
rise
on
our
behalf
within
a
fortnight
they
will
be
more
against
us
than
for
us

the
french
troops
crossed
the
vistula
at
warsaw
and
encountered
the
fifth
element
mud
led
by
murat
unable
to
make
headway
in
mud
up
to
their
knees
baffled
by
the
fabian
tactics
of
the
russians
and
lacking
the
mighty
brain
of
their
emperor
the
marshals
fought
without
cooperation
each
for
his
own
glory
lannes
was
as
bad
as
the
rest
showing
in
his
refusal
to
give
due
praise
to
his
brother
generals
for
their
help
at
pultusk
the
same
petty
spirit
of
which
he
had
complained
in
murat
during
the
long
winter
weeks
spent
in
cantonments
along
the
vistula
the
marshal
was
ill
with
fever
in
hospital
at
warsaw
and
was
not
able
to
return
to
the
head
of
his
corps
in
time
for
the
bloody
battle
of
eylau
during
may
he
commanded
the
covering
force
at
the
siege
of
dantzig
and
was
summoned
thence
to
take
part
in
the
last
phase
of
the
campaign
the
russian
general
bennigsen
allowed
himself
to
be
outgeneralled
by
napoleon
and
the
french
were
soon
nearer
königsberg
than
the
russians
bennigsen
made
desperate
efforts
to
retrieve
his
mistake
and
on
june
13th
actually
managed
to
throw
himself
across
the
alle
at
friedland
just
at
the
moment
that
lannes
arrived
on
the
scene
the
marshal
at
once
saw
his
opportunity
the
russians
were
drawn
up
with
the
alle
at
their
backs
so
that
retreat
was
impossible
and
only
victory
could
save
them
the
marshals
design
therefore
was
to
hold
the
enemy
till
the
main
french
army
arrived
bennigsen
made
the
most
determined
efforts
to
throw
him
off
attempting
to
crush
him
by
superior
weight
of
horsemen
and
artillery
but
the
marshal
held
on
to
him
grimly
and
by
magnificent
handling
of
oudinots
grenadiers
the
saxon
horse
and
grouchys
dragoons
he
maintained
his
position
in
spite
of
all
the
russian
efforts
during
the
night
of
june
13th
on
the
morning
of
the
14th
with
ten
thousand
troops
opposed
to
forty
thousand
he
fought
for
four
hours
without
giving
ground
skilfully
availing
himself
of
every
bit
of
wood
and
cover
till
at
last
reinforcements
arrived
when
the
main
french
columns
were
deployed
lannes
with
the
remnant
of
his
indomitable
corps
had
a
brief
period
of
rest
but
during
the
last
phase
of
the
battle
the
enemy
made
a
desperate
effort
to
break
out
of
the
trap
through
his
shattered
corps
and
once
again
the
marshal
led
his
troops
with
invincible
élan
and
drove
the
russians
right
into
the
deathtrap
of
friedland

tilsit
followed
and
napoleon
showered
honours
on
his
trusty
lieutenants
on
june
30
1807
he
gave
to
lannes
the
principality
of
sievers
in
the
department
of
kalish
and
on
march
19
1808
he
conferred
on
him
a
greater
honour
when
he
created
him
duke
of
montebello
in
memory
of
his
famous
victory

the
duke
of
montebello
spent
his
days
of
peace
for
the
most
part
at
lectourne
he
was
summoned
thence
in
october
1808
to
accompany
the
emperor
to
erfurt
and
there
the
czar
alexander
made
a
special
hero
of
his
old
adversary
of
austerlitz
pultusk
and
friedland
and
presented
him
with
the
grand
cordon
of
the
order
of
st
andrew

the
period
between
tilsit
and
erfurt
gave
lannes
the
last
peaceful
days
that
he
ever
spent
for
from
erfurt
he
was
hurried
off
again
to
war
this
time
to
spain
as
usual
when
there
was
hard
fighting
in
prospect
napoleon
knew
that
he
could
ill
afford
to
do
without
his
most
trusty
and
able
lieutenant
but
lannes
had
but
little
enthusiasm
for
the
spanish
war
his
reputation
stood
so
high
that
there
was
little
chance
of
enhancing
it
and
by
now
the
fireeating
republican
soldier
was
settling
down
into
a
quiet
country
gentleman
who
preferred
the
domestic
circle
and
the
pleasure
of
playing
the
grand
seigneur
before
an
audience
of
friends
to
the
stir
of
the
camp
and
the
pomp
of
the
court
but
he
was
too
well
drilled
in
soldierly
instincts
to
refuse
to
serve
when
summoned
by
his
chief
and
accordingly
much
against
his
will
he
set
out
on
what
he
expected
to
be
a
short
inglorious
campaign
of
a
couple
of
months
against
a
disorganised
provincial
militia

lannes
accompanied
the
emperor
on
his
journey
to
spain
attached
to
the
headquarter
staff
without
any
definite
command
for
the
emperor
knew
that
all
was
not
well
with
the
armies
there
but
he
could
not
until
he
had
himself
looked
into
the
question
decide
where
he
could
use
to
the
best
advantage
the
great
administrative
and
tactical
ability
of
the
duke
of
montebello
during
the
hurried
crossing
of
the
mountains
of
tolosa
the
marshal
had
the
misfortune
to
be
thrown
from
his
horse
so
severe
were
the
injuries
he
received
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
take
him
beyond
vittoria
but
larrey
the
emperors
surgeon
ordered
him
to
be
wrapped
in
the
bloody
skin
of
a
newly
killed
sheep
so
successful
was
the
prescription
that
the
marshal
was
soon
able
to
follow
the
emperor
and
rejoin
headquarters
on
his
arrival
the
emperor
sent
him
to
take
over
monceys
corps
of
thirtyfive
thousand
men
with
orders
to
attack
castañoss
fortynine
thousand
at
tudela
while
ney
with
twelve
thousand
worked
round
the
spanish
rear
on
the
morning
of
november
28th
lannes
attacked
the
spaniards
at
tudela
and
won
an
easy
victory
for
the
aragonese
under
palafox
thought
only
of
saragossa
and
the
valencians
and
andalusians
under
castaños
of
their
line
of
retreat
to
the
south
lannes
seeing
the
exaggerated
length
of
the
spanish
position
at
once
divined
the
reason
and
drove
home
an
overwhelming
attack
against
their
weak
centre
successful
as
the
battle
was
it
had
not
the
farreaching
effects
napoleon
had
desired
for
owing
to
the
mountainous
nature
of
the
ground
ney
was
unable
to
get
across
the
spanish
line
of
retreat
however
the
enemy
lost
four
thousand
men
at
tudela
and
what
was
more
important
all
their
artillery

the
battle
of
tudela
opened
the
road
to
madrid
but
when
napoleon
arrived
there
instead
of
driving
the
remnants
of
the
spanish
armies
before
him
and
sweeping
down
to
seville
he
found
that
there
was
a
pressing
danger
in
the
north
to
give
the
scattered
spaniards
a
chance
of
rallying
sir
john
moore
was
making
a
bold
advance
on
madrid
and
was
close
to
salamanca
napoleon
at
once
ordered
lannes
to
hand
over
his
corps
to
moncey
and
to
join
headquarters
the
corps
of
ney
and
a
part
of
victors
corps
were
sent
off
to
oppose
the
english
and
on
december
28th
napoleon
and
the
duke
of
montebello
set
out
to
overtake
them
the
weather
was
awful
and
the
passage
of
the
mountain
passes
in
face
of
the
blizzards
of
snow
tried
the
endurance
of
the
troops
to
the
uttermost
lannes
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
entirely
recovered
from
his
fall
joined
napoleon
in
setting
an
example
to
the
troops
at
the
head
of
the
column
marched
the
emperor
with
one
arm
linked
to
lannes
and
the
other
to
duroc
when
completely
worn
out
by
the
unaccustomed
efforts
and
by
the
weight
of
their
ridingboots
the
emperor
and
lannes
at
times
took
a
brief
rest
on
the
limber
of
a
gun
carriage
and
then
got
down
and
marched
again

when
napoleon
handed
over
the
pursuit
to
soult
he
despatched
the
duke
of
montebello
to
take
command
of
the
corps
of
junot
and
moncey
at
saragossa
on
his
arrival
on
january
22
1809
the
marshal
found
that
the
garrison
of
saragossa
was
in
much
better
heart
than
the
besiegers
for
on
the
west
the
third
corps
owing
to
illness
and
fatigue
numbered
barely
thirteen
thousand
and
gazans
division
across
the
ebro
before
the
eastern
suburb
was
scarcely
seven
thousand
strong
while
the
total
strength
of
the
garrison
was
almost
sixty
thousand
consequently
junot
and
gazan
were
seriously
contemplating
raising
the
siege
lanness
first
duty
was
to
restore
the
morale
of
the
troops
to
reprimand
the
general
officers
who
had
been
slack
in
their
duty
to
set
an
example
to
them
by
his
fiery
diligence
which
refused
to
let
him
go
to
bed
once
during
the
whole
of
the
first
week
he
was
before
saragossa
to
restore
the
courage
of
the
troops
by
daily
exposing
his
life
in
the
trenches
and
when
necessary
reconnoitring
in
person
with
the
utmost
sangfroid
right
up
to
the
spanish
positions
supervising
hospitals
reorganising
commissariat
planning
with
the
engineer
officers
new
methods
of
sapin
a
word
to
be
everywhere
and
to
do
everything
nothing
can
more
clearly
illustrate
napoleons
dictum
a
la
guerre
les
hommes
ne
sont
rien
cest
un
homme
qui
est
tout
within
five
days
of
lanness
taking
over
command
the
whole
complexion
of
the
situation
had
altered
the
french
were
making
the
most
resolute
assaults
with
irresistible
élan
carrying
out
the
most
difficult
streetfighting
with
the
greatest
zest
sapping
mining
and
blowing
up
convents
and
fortified
posts
fighting
above
ground
and
below
ground
suffering
the
most
terrible
losses
yet
ever
eager
to
fight
again
by
february
11th
thanks
to
the
new
morale
of
the
troops
and
to
the
fact
that
dysentery
and
enteric
were
playing
havoc
in
the
garrison
lannes
had
captured
house
by
house
the
western
half
of
the
town
and
had
arrived
at
the
corso
but
once
again
murmurings
broke
out
among
the
french
troops
who
had
by
now
lost
a
fourth
of
their
numbers
and
at
the
same
time
a
strong
force
of
spaniards
under
palafoxs
brothers
threatened
to
overwhelm
suchet
who
was
covering
the
siege
lannes
proved
superior
to
all
difficulties
by
his
fiery
speeches
and
tact
he
reanimated
both
officers
and
men
pointing
out
to
them
the
triumph
they
had
already
won
in
penning
in
fifty
thousand
spaniards
with
a
mere
handful
then
hurrying
off
with
reinforcements
for
suchet
he
dug
the
covering
force
into
an
entrenched
position
on
the
heights
of
villa
mayor
and
four
days
later
was
back
at
saragossa
in
time
to
superintend
the
attack
across
the
corso
on
february
18th
the
french
captured
the
suburb
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
and
thus
placed
the
inner
town
between
two
fires

disease
and
the
success
of
their
enemies
had
taken
all
the
heart
out
of
the
spanish
defence
and
on
february
20th
palafox
surrendered
between
december
21st
and
february
21st
the
spanish
losses
had
been
fiftyfour
thousand
dead
from
wounds
and
disease
and
saragossa
itself
was
but
a
heap
of
crumbling
ruins
lannes
did
all
in
his
power
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
yet
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
another
ten
thousand
died
within
the
next
month
unfortunately
also
for
his
reputation
the
marshal
acting
on
distinct
orders
from
napoleon
treated
his
military
prisoners
with
extreme
severity
and
executed
two
of
the
most
prominent
the
great
strain
of
the
siege
told
heavily
on
the
health
of
the
marshal
who
had
never
completely
recovered
from
his
accident
near
tolosa
accordingly
after
refitting
the
corps
under
his
command
he
handed
them
over
to
mortier
and
junot
and
at
the
end
of
march
set
out
for
lectourne
but
his
stay
there
was
short
for
napoleon
with
the
spanish
and
austrian
wars
on
his
hands
could
not
afford
to
do
without
his
assistance

by
april
25th
lannes
found
himself
once
again
at
the
post
of
danger
but
this
time
on
the
danube
at
the
battle
of
abensberg
as
he
himself
said
the
first
rumour
of
war
always
made
him
shiver
but
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
the
first
step
forward
he
had
no
thought
but
for
his
profession
but
much
as
he
would
have
liked
to
dally
at
lectourne
and
much
as
he
grumbled
at
napoleons
overweening
ambition
once
at
the
front
he
was
the
dashing
soldier
of
the
first
italian
campaign
he
arrived
in
time
to
take
his
share
in
the
five
days
fighting
at
abensberg
landshut
eckmühl
and
ratisbon
at
ratisbon
he
had
an
opportunity
of
showing
that
time
had
had
no
effect
on
his
spirit
after
two
storming
parties
had
been
swept
away
he
called
for
volunteers
for
a
third
attempt
none
stepped
forward
and
he
himself
rushed
to
seize
a
ladder
his
staff
held
him
back
but
the
lesson
was
not
in
vain
volunteers
crowded
to
seize
the
scaling
ladders
led
by
two
of
the
marshals
aidesdecamp
and
soon
the
walls
of
ratisbon
were
crowned
with
french
soldiers
and
the
town
was
won

napoleon
himself
accompanied
lannes
on
the
march
to
vienna
and
the
marshal
was
perfectly

there
was
no
evil
influence
to
cloud
his
friendship
with
his
great
chief
once
again
vienna
succumbed
without
a
shot
but
this
time
the
austrians
took
care
that
there
was
no
bridge
over
which
napoleon
might
cross
the
danube
accordingly
the
emperor
determined
to
bridge
the
river
below
vienna
making
use
of
the
isle
of
lobau
which
lay
twothirds
of
the
way
across
the
bridge
from
the
south
bank
to
lobau
was
built
under
the
personal
supervision
of
the
emperor
and
lannes
and
on
one
occasion
when
they
were
reconnoitring
in
person
they
both
fell
into
the
river
and
the
marshal
who
was
out
of
his
depth
was
pulled
out
by
the
emperor
himself

by
may
20th
the
french
army
was
concentrated
in
lobau
and
on
may
21st
a
crossing
was
effected
by
several
bridges
and
assured
by
masséna
occupying
the
village
of
aspern
and
lannes
that
of
essling
by
the
morning
of
the
22nd
the
mass
of
the
french
army
had
reached
the
north
bank
of
the
river
napoleon
who
perceived
that
the
austrian
line
was
too
extended
to
be
strong
gave
the
command
of
the
centre
to
lannes
with
orders
to
sally
forth
from
between
the
villages
of
aspern
and
essling
and
break
the
enemys
centre
in
spite
of
a
devastating
artillery
fire
the
marshal
carried
out
his
orders
to
perfection
making
skilful
use
of
his
infantry
and
cavalry
he
had
actually
forced
back
the
austrians
when
he
was
recalled
by
napoleon
who
had
just
heard
that
the
enemy
had
succeeded
in
breaking
the
bridge
by
sending
huge
masses
of
timber
down
the
swollen
river
lannes
retreated
slowly
on
essling
his
troops
suffering
severely
from
the
reformed
austrian
batteries
while
thus
holding
the
foe
in
check
the
marshal
was
struck
on
the
knee
by
a
cannon
ball
which
ricocheted
off
the
ground
just
in
front
of
him
he
was
removed
to
the
rear
and
the
doctors
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
amputate
the
right
leg
the
marshal
bore
the
operation
well
he
was
moved
to
vienna
and
sent
for
the
celebrated
mechanician
mesler
to
make
him
a
false
leg
but
unfortunately
the
hot
weather
affected
the
wound
and
mortification
set
in
the
emperor
in
spite
of
his
anxieties
came
daily
to
visit
him
and
the
dying
hero
had
the
last
consolation
of
seeing
how
much
he
was
valued
by
his
august
master
and
friend
the
end
came
soon
on
may
30th
the
duke
of
montebello
died
and
napoleon
on
hearing
the
news
with
tears
in
his
eyes
cried
out
what
a
loss
for
france
and
for
me

the
death
of
lannes
removed
the
first
of
napoleons
chosen
paladins
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
emperor
himself
perhaps
the
greatest
soldier
of
them
all
at
st
helena
the
fallen
emperor
thus
appraised
his
old
comrade
lannes
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
bravery
calm
under
fire
he
possessed
a
sure
and
penetrating
coup
doeil
he
had
great
experience
in
war
as
a
general
he
was
infinitely
superior
to
moreau
and
soult
but
high
as
this
eulogy
is
the
fact
remains
that
lannes
was
lucky
in
the
time
of
his
death
fortune
had
not
yet
set
her
face
against
napoleons
arms
and
he
was
spared
the
terrors
of
the
russian
retreat
the
terrible
fighting
at
leipzig
and
the
gloom
and
misery
of
the
winter
campaign
in
france
that
lannes
would
have
emerged
superior
to
these
trials
his
previous
career
affords
strong
reason
to
presume
yet
brilliant
as
were
his
actions
at
montebello
saalfeld
pultusk
and
tudela
masterly
as
were
his
operations
at
the
siege
of
saragossa
they
only
prove
the
marshals
command
of
the
technique
of
tactics
as
davout
has
pointed
out
the
duke
of
montebello
had
never
an
opportunity
of
showing
his
ability
in
the
field
of
grand
tactics
or
in
the
higher
conceptions
of
strategy
he
was
a
past
master
in
the
art
of
manoeuvring
twentyfive
thousand
infantry
but
he
had
never
the
opportunity
of
devising
and
carrying
out
a
complete
campaign
involving
the
handling
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
and
the
successful
solution
of
problems
both
military
and
political
the
roland
of
the
french
army
had
by
nature
many
qualities
which
go
to
form
a
great
soldier
his
bravery
was
undoubted
before
ney
he
was
called
the
bravest
of
the
brave
he
had
personal
qualities
which
inspired
his
troops
with
his
own
courage
and
élan
he
had
the
military
eye
and
a
mind
of
extraordinary
activity
which
worked
best
when
under
the
pressure
of
necessity
and
danger
he
was
physically
strong
and
able
to
endure
fatigue
and
he
had
great
capacity
for
taking
pains
but
his
temper
was
often
at
fault
causing
him
to
burst
into
fits
of
uncontrollable
rage
while
from
jealousy
he
was
apt
to
sulk
and
refuse
to
cooperate
with
his
fellows
if
an
officer
failed
to
grasp
his
meaning
he
would
storm
at
him
and
attempt
himself
to
carry
out
the
task
but
on
one
occasion
he
heard
the
emperor
cry
out
that
devil
lannes
possesses
all
the
qualities
of
a
great
commander
but
he
will
never
be
one
because
he
cannot
master
his
temper
and
is
constantly
bickering
with
his
subalterns
the
greatest
fault
that
a
commander
can
make
from
that
day
forward
lannes
made
the
resolution
to
command
his
temper
and
in
spite
of
his
nature
his
selfcontrol
became
extraordinary
but
though
he
conquered
this
weakness
he
never
overcame
his
jealousy
of
his
fellow
marshals
and
generals
again
and
again
he
threw
up
his
command
because
he
thought
he
was
slighted
or
that
others
were
preferred
to
him
at
times
he
broke
out
into
violent
tirades
against
the
emperor
himself
and
on
one
occasion
in
his
jealousy
told
him
that
murat
his
brotherinlaw
was
a
mountebank
a
tightrope
dancer
napoleon
remonstrated
with
him
exclaiming
it
is
i
alone
who
give
you
both
glory
and
success
lannes
livid
with
anger
retaliated
yes
yes
because
you
have
marched
up
to
your
ankles
in
gore
on
this
bloody
field
you
think
yourself
a
great
man
and
your
emplumed
brotherinlaw
crows
on
his
own
dunghill
twelve
thousand
corpses
lying
on
the
plain
to
keep
the
field
for
your
honour

and
yet
to
deny
meto
me
lannesmy
due
share
in
the
honours
of
the
day
on
the
day
before
his
death
he
could
not
resist
humiliating
his
hated
enemy
bessières
whom
napoleon
had
put
under
his
command
and
he
actually
insulted
him
on
the
field
of
battle
by
sending
a
junior
aidedecamp
to
tell
the
marshal
to
charge
home
implying
that
he
was
shirking
his
duty

as
a
man
lannes
was
warmhearted
and
beloved
by
his
family
his
staff
and
his
men
rough
diamond
as
he
was
he
was
truly
one
of
natures
gentlemen
he
never
forgot
a
friend
though
he
seldom
if
ever
forgave
an
enemy
his
sympathies
were
essentially
democratic
himself
one
of
the
people
he
believed
thoroughly
in
republican
ideas
outspoken
to
a
fault
he
would
flare
out
against
napoleon
himself
but
one
kind
word
from
his
great
chief
would
cause
him
to
forget
all
his
bitterness
his
impetuosity
and
his
republican
ideals
of
equality
were
naturally
extremely
offensive
on
occasions
to
the
emperor
and
the
new
nobility
and
lannes
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
was
too
genuine
to
conceal
his
hatred
of
all
flunkeyism
it
was
this
gascon
selfconfidence
blended
with
singular
amiability
of
character
which
while
it
offended
the
court
attached
to
the
marshal
his
soldiers
and
the
provincial
society
of
lectourne
where
even
to
this
day
the
name
of
the
duke
of
montebello
is
held
in
the
most
affectionate
esteem
and
regard

go

i
am
satisfied
with
you
you
will
make
your
way
so
spoke
a
captain
of
hussars
to
a
young
recruit
who
had
attracted
his
attention
the
captain
little
thought
that
the
zealous
stripling
would
one
day
become
a
marshal
of
france
the
prince
of
moskowa
and
famed
throughout
europe
as
the
bravest
of
the
brave
still
the
youth
had
presentiments
of
future
greatness
born
on
january
10
1769
the
son
of
a
poor
cooper
of
sarrelouis
more
german
than
french
michel
ney
at
the
age
of
fifteen
was
possessed
with
the
idea
that
he
was
destined
for
distinction
his
father
and
mother
tried
to
persuade
him
to
become
a
miner
but
nothing
would
please
the
highspirited
boy
save
the
life
of
a
soldier
accordingly
on
february
1
1787
he
tramped
off
to
metz
and
enlisted
as
a
private
in
the
regiment
known
as
the
colonel
generals
hussars
physically
strong
unusually
active
by
nature
a
horseman
he
soon
attracted
the
attention
of
his
comrades
by
his
skill
in
ménage
and
his
command
of
the
sabre
and
was
chosen
to
represent
his
regiment
in
a
duel
against
the
fencing
master
of
another
regiment
of
the
garrison
unfortunately
for
ney
the
authorities
got
wind
of
the
affair
in
time
to
prevent
any
decision
being
arrived
at
and
the
young
soldier
was
punished
for
breaking
regulations
by
a
term
of
imprisonment
but
no
sooner
was
he
released
than
he
again
challenged
his
opponent
this
time
there
was
no
interference
and
ney
so
severely
wounded
his
adversary
that
he
was
unable
to
continue
his
profession
though
he
thus
early
in
his
career
distinguished
himself
by
his
bravery
tenacity
and
disregard
of
rules
it
must
not
for
a
moment
be
thought
that
he
was
a
mere
swashbuckler
with
the
determination
to
rise
firmly
before
his
eyes
he
set
about
from
the
day
he
enlisted
to
learn
thoroughly
the
rudiments
of
his
profession
and
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
french
and
the
faculty
of
reading
and
writing
thus
he
was
able
to
pass
the
necessary
tests
and
quickly
gained
the
rank
of
sergeant
ney
was
fortunate
in
that
he
had
not
to
spend
long
years
as
a
noncommissioned
officer
with
no
obvious
future
before
him
the
revolution
gave
him
the
opportunity
so
long
desired
by
masséna
and
others
and
it
was
as
lieutenant
that
he
started
on
active
service
with
dumouriezs
army
in
1793
once
on
active
service
it
was
not
long
before
his
great
qualities
made
themselves
recognised
though
absolutely
uncultivated
save
for
the
smattering
of
reading
and
writing
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
regimental
school
and
to
outward
appearances
rather
heavy
and
stupid
in
the
midst
of
danger
he
showed
an
energy
a
quickness
of
intuition
and
a
clearness
of
understanding
which
hurled
aside
the
most
formidable
obstacles
physical
fear
he
never
knew
as
he
said
when
asked
if
he
ever
felt
afraid
no
i
never
had
time
in
his
earliest
engagements
at
neerwinden
and
in
the
north
of
france
he
foreshadowed
his
future
career
by
the
extraordinary
bravery
and
resource
he
showed
in
handling
his
squadron
of
cavalry
during
the
retreat
on
one
occasion
with
some
twenty
hussars
completely
routing
three
hundred
of
the
enemys
horse
this
achievement
attracted
the
attention
of
general
kléber
who
sent
for
captain
ney
and
entrusted
him
with
the
formation
of
a
body
of
franctireurs
of
all
arms
the
franctireurs
were
really
recognised
brigands
they
received
no
pay
or
arms
and
lived
entirely
on
plunder
but
were
extremely
useful
for
scouting
and
reconnaissance
and
collected
a
great
deal
of
information
under
a
dashing
officer
from
this
congenial
work
ney
was
summoned
in
1796
to
command
the
cavalry
of
general
colands
division
in
the
army
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
there
he
distinguished
himself
by
capturing
würzburg
and
two
thousand
of
the
enemy
with
a
squadron
of
one
hundred
hussars
after
this
exploit
general
kléber
refused
to
listen
to
his
remonstrances
and
insisted
on
his
accepting
his
promotion
as
general
of
brigade
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
of
1797
ney
had
the
misfortune
to
be
taken
prisoner
at
giessen
while
covering
the
retreat
with
his
cavalry
he
saw
a
horse
artillery
gun
deserted
by
its
men
galloping
back
by
himself
he
attempted
to
save
the
piece
but
the
enemys
horse
swept
down
and
captured
him
his
captivity
was
not
long
his
exchange
was
soon
effected
and
he
returned
to
france
in
time
to
join
in
the
agitation
against
the
party
of
the
clicheans
the
only
occasion
he
actively
interfered
in
politics

on
the
reopening
of
the
war
in
1799
ney
was
sent
to
command
the
cavalry
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
the
campaign
was
notable
for
an
exploit
which
admirably
illustrates
the
secret
of
his
success
as
a
soldier
the
town
of
mannheim
held
by
a
large
austrian
garrison
was
the
key
of
southern
germany
the
french
army
was
separated
from
this
fortress
by
the
broad
rhine
the
enemy
was
confident
that
any
attempt
on
the
fortress
must
be
preceded
by
the
passage
of
the
river
by
the
whole
french
army
but
ney
hearing
that
the
enemys
troops
were
cantonned
in
the
villages
surrounding
the
town
saw
that
if
a
small
french
force
could
be
smuggled
across
by
night
it
might
be
possible
to
seize
the
town
by
a
coupdemain
the
most
important
thing
to
ascertain
was
the
exact
position
of
the
cantonments
of
the
troops
outside
the
fortress
and
of
the
various
guards
and
sentinels
inside
the
town
so
important
did
he
consider
this
information
that
he
determined
to
cross
the
river
himself
and
reconnoitre
the
position
in
person
accordingly
general
of
division
as
he
was
he
disguised
himself
as
a
prussian
and
trusting
to
his
early
knowledge
of
german
he
crossed
the
river
secretly
and
carefully
noted
all
the
enemys
preparations
running
the
risk
of
being
found
out
and
shot
as
a
spy
the
following
evening
with
a
weak
detachment
he
again
crossed
the
river
attacked
the
enemys
guards
with
the
bayonet
drove
back
a
sortie
of
the
garrison
and
entered
the
town
pellmell
with
the
flying
enemy
and
under
cover
of
the
darkness
which
hid
the
paucity
of
his
troops
he
bluffed
the
enemy
into
surrender
the
year
1800
brought
him
further
glory
under
masséna
and
moreau
and
he
became
known
throughout
the
armies
of
france
as
the
indefatigable

after
the
treaty
of
lunéville
the
first
consul
summoned
ney
to
paris
and
won
his
affection
by
the
warmth
with
which
he
received
him
on
his
departure
bonaparte
presented
him
with
a
sword
receive
this
weapon
he
said
as
a
souvenir
of
the
friendship
and
esteem
i
have
towards
you
it
belonged
to
a
pasha
who
met
his
death
bravely
on
the
field
of
aboukir
the
sword
became
neys
most
treasured
possession
he
was
never
tired
of
handling
it
and
he
never
let
it
go
out
of
his
sight
but
he
little
thought
what
ill
luck
it
would
bring
him
later
for
it
was
this
famous
sword
which
in
1815
revealed
to
the
police
his
hidingplace
and
thus
indirectly
led
him
to
death
the
relations
between
ney
and
the
first
consul
soon
became
closer
the
general
married
a
great
friend
of
hortense
beauharnais
mademoiselle
auguie
the
daughter
of
marie
antoinettes
lady
in
waiting
sure
of
his
devotion
and
perceiving
the
sternness
with
which
he
obeyed
orders
in
1802
the
first
consul
entrusted
him
with
the
subjugation
of
switzerland
the
swiss
army
fled
before
him
and
a
deputation
charged
to
make
their
submission
to
france
arrived
in
his
camp
with
the
keys
of
the
principal
towns
the
general
met
them
listened
courteously
to
their
words
of
submission
then
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
refused
the
keys
with
that
insight
which
later
led
him
to
warn
napoleon
against
attempting
to
trample
on
the
people
of
spain
and
russia
he
replied
to
the
deputation
it
is
not
the
keys
i
demand
my
cannon
can
force
your
gates
bring
me
hearts
full
of
submission
worthy
of
the
friendship
of
france
soon
afterwards
with
soult
and
davout
ney
was
honoured
with
the
command
of
one
of
the
corps
in
the
army
which
the
first
consul
was
assembling
for
the
invasion
of
england
in
selecting
him
for
this
important
post
napoleon
showed
that
power
of
discrimination
which
contributed
so
greatly
to
his
success
for
save
in
the
raid
into
switzerland
ney
had
not
yet
been
called
upon
to
deal
with
complicated
questions
of
administration
and
finance
his
reputation
rested
purely
on
his
extraordinary
dash
and
bravery
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
and
his
power
of
using
to
the
full
the
élan
which
lies
latent
in
all
french
armies
for
when
not
in
touch
with
the
enemy
he
was
notoriously
indolent
he
never
made
any
attempt
to
learn
the
abstract
science
of
war
and
until
stirred
by
danger
his
character
seemed
to
slumber
others
judged
him
as
the
emperor
did
at
st
helena
when
he
said
he
was
the
bravest
of
men
there
terminated
all
his
faculties
but
in
spite
of
this
limitation
in
his
character
napoleon
employed
him
again
and
again
in
positions
of
responsibility
for
he
knew
that
neys
word
once
passed
was
never
broken
that
his
devotion
to
france
and
to
its
ruler
was
steadfast
that
in
spite
of
his
peevishness
and
his
fierce
outbursts
of
temper
and
bitter
tirades
when
it
came
to
deeds
there
would
be
no
wavering
consequently
the
first
consul
availed
himself
gladly
of
his
great
reputation
for
bravery
considering
that
hero
worship
did
more
to
turn
the
young
recruits
into
soldiers
than
the
greatest
organising
and
administrative
talents
moreover
napoleon
kept
an
eye
on
the
composition
of
the
staff
of
his
marshals
and
generals
and
he
knew
that
ney
had
in
jomini
the
chief
of
his
staff
a
man
of
admirable
talent
and
sagacity
who
would
turn
in
their
proper
direction
the
sledgehammer
blows
of
the
bravest
of
the
brave

with
the
creation
of
the
empire
ney
was
included
among
the
paladins
of
the
new
charlemagne
and
received
his
marshals
bâton
the
grand
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
the
order
of
the
christ
of
portugal
but
the
new
marshal
cared
little
for
the
life
of
a
courtier
much
as
he
prized
his
military
distinctions
banquets
and
feasting
offered
little
attraction
to
the
hero
and
he
despised
riches
and
rank
gentlemen
said
he
one
day
to
his
aidesdecamp
who
were
boasting
of
their
families
and
rich
appointments
gentlemen
i
am
more
fortunate
than
you
i
got
nothing
from
my
family
and
i
esteemed
myself
rich
at
metz
when
i
had
two
loaves
of
bread
on
the
table
accordingly
no
young
subaltern
thirsting
for
glory
was
happier
that
marshal
ney
when
in
august
1805
the
order
came
to
march
on
austria
the
campaign
so
suddenly
commenced
brought
the
marshal
the
hard
fighting
and
the
glory
he
loved
so
well
in
the
operations
round
ulm
he
surpassed
himself
by
the
tenacity
with
which
he
stuck
to
the
enemy
and
thanks
to
the
skill
of
jomini
his
errors
only
added
to
his
fame
and
the
combat
of
elchingen
became
immortal
when
napoleon
selected
this
name
as
a
title
for
the
marshal
when
he
created
him
duke
during
the
fighting
which
penned
the
austrians
into
ulm
two
sides
of
the
marshals
character
were
clearly
seenhis
extraordinary
bravery
and
his
jealousy
the
emperor
anxious
for
the
complete
success
of
his
plans
despatched
an
officer
to
command
ney
to
avoid
incurring
a
repulse
and
to
await
reinforcements
the
aidedecamp
found
him
in
the
faubourg
of
the
town
amongst
the
skirmishers
he
delivered
his
message
whereupon
the
marshal
replied
tell
the
emperor
that
i
share
the
glory
with
no
one
i
have
already
provided
for
a
flank
attack
in
september
1806
ney
was
ordered
to
march
to
würzburg
to
join
the
grand
army
for
the
war
against
prussia
the
campaign
gave
him
just
those
opportunities
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
seize
and
before
the
end
of
the
war
the
emperor
had
changed
his
sobriquet
from
the
indefatigable
to
the
bravest
of
the
brave
but
glorious
as
his
conduct
was
his
rash
impetuosity
more
than
once
seriously
compromised
napoleons
plans
at
jena
his
rashness
and
his
jealousy
of
his
fellow
marshals
caused
him
to
advance
before
the
other
corps
had
taken
up
their
positions
his
isolated
attack
was
defeated
by
the
prussians
and
it
took
the
united
efforts
of
lannes
and
soult
to
rally
his
shattered
battalions
and
snatch
victory
from
the
enemy
but
his
personal
bravery
at
jena
his
brilliant
pursuit
of
the
enemy
the
audacity
with
which
he
bluffed
fourteen
thousand
prussians
to
surrender
at
erfurt
and
his
capture
of
twentythree
thousand
prisoners
and
eight
hundred
cannon
at
the
great
fortress
of
magdeburg
made
ample
amends
for
his
errors

but
glorious
as
was
his
success
his
impetuosity
soon
brought
him
into
further
disgrace
detached
from
the
main
army
on
the
lower
vistula
in
the
spring
of
1807
he
advanced
against
a
mixed
force
of
prussians
and
russians
before
napoleon
had
completed
all
his
plans
the
emperor
was
furious
and
berthier
was
ordered
to
write
that
the
emperor
has
in
forming
his
plans
no
need
of
advice
or
of
any
one
acting
on
his
own
responsibility
no
one
knows
his
thoughts
it
is
our
duty
to
obey
but
to
obey
orders
when
in
contact
with
the
enemy
was
just
what
the
fiery
soldier
was
unable
to
do
and
the
emperor
recognising
this
full
well
ordered
his
chief
of
the
staff
to
write
that
his
majesty
believes
that
the
position
of
the
enemy
is
due
to
the
rash
manoeuvre
made
by
marshal
ney
when
the
main
advance
commenced
the
marshal
was
summoned
to
rejoin
the
grand
army
he
did
not
arrive
in
time
to
take
any
prominent
share
in
the
bloody
battle
of
eylau
in
spite
of
every
exertion
his
corps
only
reached
the
field
of
battle
as
darkness
set
in
the
sight
of
the
awful
carnage
affected
even
the
warworn
marshal
and
made
him
exclaim
what
a
massacre
and
as
he
added
without
any
issue
friedland
was
a
battle
after
neys
own
heart
he
arrived
on
the
field
at
the
moment
napoleon
was
opening
his
grand
attack
and
with
his
corps
he
was
ordered
to
assault
the
enemys
left
hurling
division
after
division
by
handtohand
fighting
he
drove
the
enemy
back
from
their
lines
and
flung
them
into
the
trap
of
friedland
there
to
fall
by
hundreds
under
the
fierce
fire
of
the
french
massed
batteries
it
was
his
sangfroid
which
was
responsible
for
the
devotion
with
which
the
soldiers
rushed
against
the
enemy
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
some
of
the
younger
grenadiers
kept
bobbing
their
heads
under
the
hail
of
bullets
which
almost
darkened
the
air
comrades
called
out
the
marshal
who
was
on
horseback
the
enemy
are
firing
in
the
air
here
am
i
higher
than
the
top
of
your
busbies
and
they
dont
hurt
me

after
the
peace
of
tilsit
ney
soon
duke
of
elchingen
had
a
years
repose
from
war
but
in
1808
he
was
one
of
those
summoned
to
retrieve
the
errors
arising
from
napoleons
mistaken
calculation
of
the
spanish
problem
the
selection
was
an
unfortunate
one
accustomed
to
the
ordinary
warfare
of
central
europe
at
his
best
in
the
mêlée
of
battle
in
spain
where
organised
resistance
was
seldom
met
where
the
foe
vanished
at
the
first
contact
the
marshal
showed
a
hesitation
and
vacillation
strangely
in
contrast
with
his
dashing
conduct
on
the
battlefield
fine
soldier
as
he
was
he
lacked
the
essentials
of
the
successful
generalimagination
and
moral
courage
he
was
unable
to
discern
in
his
minds
eye
what
lay
on
the
other
side
of
a
hill
and
the
blank
which
this
lack
of
imagination
caused
in
his
mind
affected
his
nerves
and
made
him
irresolute
and
irritable
moreover
in
spain
the
success
of
the
emperors
plans
depended
on
the
loyal
cooperation
of
marshal
with
marshal
but
unfortunately
ney
obsessed
by
jealousy
was
most
difficult
to
work
with
as
napoleon
himself
said
no
one
knew
what
it
was
to
deal
with
two
men
like
ney
and
soult
from
the
very
outset
of
his
career
in
spain
he
showed
a
lack
of
strategic
insight
and
a
want
of
rapidity
of
movement
thus
it
was
that
he
was
unable
to
assist
lannes
in
the
operations
which
the
emperor
had
planned
for
the
annihilation
of
the
spaniards
at
tudela
his
heart
was
not
in
the
work
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
hide
this
from
napoleon
when
the
emperor
before
leaving
spain
reviewed
his
troops
and
told
him
that
romana
would
be
accounted
for
in
a
fortnight
the
english
are
beaten
and
will
make
no
more
effort
that
all
will
be
quiet
here
in
three
months
the
duke
of
elchingen
boldly
told
him
the
men
of
this
country
are
obstinate
and
the
women
and
children
fight
i
see
no
end
to
the
war
it
was
with
gloomy
forebodings
therefore
that
he
saw
the
emperor
ride
off
to
france
but
what
increased
his
dislike
of
the
whole
situation
was
that
his
operations
were
made
subservient
to
those
of
soult
his
old
enemy
and
rival
the
hatred
which
existed
between
the
two
was
of
long
standing
and
had
burned
fiercely
ever
since
the
days
of
jena
when
soult
had
been
mainly
instrumental
in
retrieving
the
disaster
threatened
by
neys
impetuosity
it
came
to
a
head
when
after
the
duke
of
dalmatias
expulsion
from
portugal
the
armies
of
the
two
marshals
met
at
lugo
soults
corps
arrived
without
cannon
or
baggage
a
mere
armed
rabble
and
neys
men
jeered
at
the
disorganised
battalions
the
marshals
themselves
took
sides
with
their
men
matters
were
not
improved
when
joseph
sent
orders
that
ney
was
to
consider
himself
under
soult
and
though
napoleon
himself
confirmed
the
decision
it
brought
no
peace
between
the
rival
commanders
all
through
the
talavera
campaign
there
was
perpetual
discord
and
it
was
neys
hesitation
arising
from
vacillation
or
jealousy
which
prevented
soult
from
cutting
off
the
english
retreat
across
the
tagus

after
the
battle
of
wagram
masséna
was
despatched
to
spain
to
command
the
army
of
portugal
the
duke
of
elchingen
showed
to
his
new
chief
the
same
spirit
of
disobedience
and
hatred
of
control
at
times
slack
and
supine
in
his
arrangements
as
in
the
preparations
for
the
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
in
his
want
of
energy
after
the
siege
of
almeida
at
other
times
upsetting
his
superiors
plans
by
his
reckless
impetuosity
he
was
a
subordinate
whom
no
one
cared
to
command
still
when
it
came
to
actual
contact
with
the
foe
no
officer
was
able
to
extract
so
much
from
his
men
and
his
defeat
of
crawfords
division
on
the
coa
and
his
dash
at
busaco
were
quite
up
to
his
great
reputation
before
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
his
illhumour
broke
out
again
he
bitterly
opposed
the
idea
of
an
assault
and
he
grumbled
at
being
kept
before
the
position
in
fact
nothing
that
his
chief
could
order
was
right
it
was
to
a
great
extent
owing
to
the
conduct
of
the
duke
of
elchingen
that
masséna
was
at
last
compelled
to
retreat
as
he
wrote
to
berthier
i
have
done
all
i
could
to
keep
the
army
out
of
spain
as
long
as
possible

but
i
have
been
continually
opposed
i
make
bold
to
say
by
the
commanders
of
the
corps
darmée
who
have
roused
such
a
spirit
amongst
officers
and
men
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
hold
our
present
position
any
longer
when
however
the
retreat
was
at
last
ordered
ney
showed
to
the
full
his
immense
tactical
ability
although
the
army
was
greatly
demoralised
during
the
retreat
through
portugal
he
never
lost
a
single
gun
or
baggage
wagon
as
napier
wrote
day
after
day
neythe
indomitable
neyoffered
battle
with
the
rear
guard
and
a
stream
of
fire
ran
along
the
wasted
valleys
of
portugal
from
the
tagus
to
the
mondego
from
the
mondego
to
the
coa
as
often
as
wellington
with
his
forty
thousand
men
overtook
the
marshal
with
his
ten
thousand
he
was
baffled
by
the
tactical
cleverness
with
which
his
adversary
compelled
him
to
deploy
his
whole
force
only
to
find
before
him
a
vanishing
rear
guard
but
while
displaying
such
brilliant
ability
the
duke
of
elchingen
would
take
no
orders
from
his
superior
and
when
masséna
told
him
to
cover
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
he
flatly
refused
and
marched
off
in
the
opposite
direction
thereon
the
prince
of
essling
was
compelled
to
remove
him
from
his
command
and
wrote
to
berthier
i
have
been
reduced
to
an
extremity
which
i
have
earnestly
endeavoured
to
avoid
the
marshal
the
duke
of
elchingen
has
arrived
at
the
climax
of
disobedience
i
have
given
the
sixth
corps
to
count
loison
senior
general
of
division
it
is
grievous
for
an
old
soldier
who
has
commanded
armies
for
so
many
years
to
arrive
at
such
a
pass

with
one
of
his
comrades
the
duke
of
elchingen
since
my
arrival
has
not
ceased
to
thwart
me
in
my
military
operations
his
character
is
well
known
i
will
say
no
more
thus
ney
returned
to
france
in
disgrace
with
his
comrades
and
hated
by
his
enemies
owing
to
the
licence
he
allowed
his
soldiers

the
emperor
however
much
as
he
insisted
on
blind
obedience
to
his
own
orders
soon
forgave
the
duke
of
elchingen
and
heaped
his
wrath
on
the
unfortunate
masséna
whom
he
held
responsible
for
the
failure
of
the
campaign
in
portugal
accordingly
when
in
1812
he
planned
his
russian
campaign
he
entrusted
ney
with
the
command
of
the
third
corps
under
the
personal
eye
of
napoleon
the
duke
of
elchingen
was
a
different
man
to
the
ney
of
spain
at
smolensk
he
showed
his
old
brilliancy
and
after
the
battle
he
opposed
the
further
advance
into
russia
maintaining
that
so
far
the
russians
had
never
been
beaten
but
only
dislodged
that
the
peasants
were
hostile
and
once
again
reminding
the
emperor
of
his
failure
in
spain
it
was
with
great
disapprobation
that
he
heard
napoleon
accept
caulaincourts
advice
and
determine
to
advance
to
moscow
pray
heaven
he
said
that
the
blarney
of
the
ambassador
general
may
not
be
more
injurious
to
the
army
than
the
most
bloody
battle
gloomy
as
were
his
forebodings
they
had
no
effect
on
his
conduct
when
he
met
the
enemy
and
he
won
for
himself
the
title
of
prince
of
moskowa
in
the
hardfought
battle
outside
the
walls
of
moscow
but
it
is
the
retreat
that
has
made
his
name
so
glorious
after
the
first
few
days
he
was
entrusted
with
command
of
the
rear
guard
and
as
demoralisation
set
in
he
alone
was
able
to
keep
the
soldiers
to
their
duty
at
krasnoi
his
feeble
corps
of
six
thousand
men
was
surrounded
by
thirty
thousand
russians
the
main
body
was
beyond
recall
when
summoned
to
lay
down
his
arms
he
replied
a
marshal
of
france
never
surrenders
and
closing
his
shattered
columns
he
charged
the
enemys
batteries
and
drove
them
from
the
field
for
three
days
he
struggled
on
surrounded
by
the
foe
on
one
occasion
when
the
enemy
suddenly
appeared
in
force
where
least
expected
his
men
fell
back
in
dismay
but
the
marshal
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
ordered
the
charge
to
be
beaten
shouting
out
comrades
now
is
the
moment
forward
they
are
ours
at
last
with
but
fifteen
hundred
men
left
he
regained
the
main
body
near
orcha
when
napoleon
heard
of
their
arrival
he
rushed
to
meet
the
marshal
exclaiming
i
have
three
hundred
million
francs
in
my
coffers
at
the
tuileries
i
would
willingly
have
given
them
to
save
marshal
ney
he
embraced
the
duke
saying
he
had
no
regret
for
the
troops
which
were
lost
because
they
had
preserved
his
dear
cousin
the
duke
of
elchingen
at
the
crossing
of
the
beresina
ney
once
again
covered
himself
with
glory
and
through
the
remainder
of
the
terrible
retreat
he
commanded
the
rear
guard
and
was
the
last
man
to
cross
the
niemen
at
kovno
and
reach
german
soil
general
dumas
one
of
the
officers
of
the
general
staff
relates
how
he
was
resting
in
an
inn
at
gumbinnen
when
one
evening
a
man
entered
clad
in
a
long
brown
cloak
wearing
a
long
beard
his
face
blackened
with
powder
his
whiskers
half
burned
by
fire
but
his
eyes
sparkling
with
brilliant
lustre
well
here
i
am
at
last
he
said
what
general
dumas
do
you
not
know
me
no
who
are
you
i
am
the
rear
guard
of
the
grand
armymarshal
ney
i
have
fired
the
last
musket
on
the
bridge
of
kovno
i
have
thrown
into
the
niemen
the
last
of
our
arms
and
i
have
walked
hither
as
you
see
across
the
forests

the
campaign
of
1813
saw
the
duke
of
elchingen
once
again
at
the
emperors
side
at
lützen
his
corps
of
conscripts
fought
nobly
five
times
the
gallant
ney
led
them
to
the
attack
five
times
they
responded
to
the
call
of
their
leader
as
he
himself
said
i
doubt
if
i
could
have
done
the
same
thing
with
the
old
grenadiers
of
the
guard
the
docility
and
perhaps
inexperience
of
those
brave
boys
served
me
better
than
the
tried
courage
of
veterans
the
french
infantry
can
never
be
too
young
but
at
bautzen
he
showed
another
phase
of
his
character
entrusted
with
sixty
thousand
men
with
orders
to
make
a
vast
turning
movement
his
timidity
spoiled
the
emperors
careful
plans
so
hesitating
and
uncertain
were
his
dispositions
that
the
allies
had
ample
time
to
meet
his
attack
and
quietly
withdrew
without
being
compromised
leaving
not
a
cannon
or
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
french
well
might
the
emperor
cry
out
what
after
such
a
butchery
no
results
no
prisoners
but
in
spite
of
neys
lack
of
strategic
skill
and
his
wellknown
vacillation
when
confronted
with
problems
he
did
not
understand
napoleon
was
forced
to
employ
him
on
an
independent
command
after
oudinot
was
beaten
at
grosbeeren
he
despatched
him
to
take
command
of
the
army
opposed
to
the
mixed
force
of
the
allies
under
bernadotte
which
was
threatening
his
communications
from
the
direction
of
berlin
but
ney
was
no
more
successful
than
oudinot
his
dispositions
were
even
worse
than
those
of
the
duke
of
reggio
and
at
dennewitz
night
alone
saved
his
force
from
absolute
annihilation
while
he
had
to
confess
to
nine
hundred
killed
and
wounded
and
fifteen
thousand
taken
prisoners
he
but
wrote
the
truth
in
his
despatch
to
the
emperor
i
have
been
totally
beaten
and
still
do
not
know
whether
my
army
has
reassembled
at
leipzig
also
he
was
responsible
for
the
want
of
success
during
the
first
day
of
the
battle
and
spent
the
time
in
useless
marching
and
countermarching
in
this
case
however
the
faulty
orders
he
received
were
largely
responsible
for
his
errors
but
all
through
the
campaign
he
felt
the
want
of
the
clear
counsel
of
the
born
strategist
jomini
his
former
chief
of
the
staff
who
had
gone
over
to
the
allies

during
the
winter
campaign
in
1814
in
france
no
one
fought
more
fiercely
and
stubbornly
than
the
duke
of
elchingen
when
the
end
came
and
paris
had
surrendered
he
was
one
of
those
who
at
fontainebleau
refused
to
march
on
paris
in
spite
of
the
cries
of
the
guard
to
paris
angered
by
the
tenacity
with
which
the
marshals
protested
against
the
folly
of
such
a
march
the
emperor
at
last
exclaimed
the
army
will
obey
me
no
replied
ney
it
will
obey
its
commanders
macdonald
who
had
just
arrived
with
his
weary
troops
backed
him
up
exclaiming
we
have
had
enough
of
war
without
kindling
a
civil
war
thereon
napoleon
was
induced
to
sign
a
proclamation
offering
to
abdicate
and
caulaincourt
macdonald
and
ney
set
out
for
paris
to
try
and
get
terms
from
the
czar
once
in
the
capital
the
marshal
seemed
to
despair
of
his
commission
feeble
and
irresolute
he
was
easily
gained
over
by
talleyrand
and
at
once
made
his
formal
adhesion
to
the
provisional
government
when
the
commissioners
returned
to
the
emperor
he
saw
but
too
clearly
that
his
day
was
done
oh
he
exclaimed
you
want
repose
have
it
then
alas
you
know
not
how
many
disappointments
and
dangers
await
you
on
your
beds
of
down

the
emperors
prophecy
was
but
too
true
though
honours
were
showered
upon
him
the
peace
which
followed
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
brought
but
little
satisfaction
and
enjoyment
to
the
duke
of
elchingen
accustomed
to
the
bustle
and
hurry
of
a
soldiers
life
he
was
too
old
to
acquire
the
tastes
of
a
life
of
tranquillity
books
brought
him
no
satisfaction
since
he
could
scarcely
read
society
frightened
him
and
his
plain
manners
and
blunt
speech
shocked
the
salons
of
paris
and
grated
on
the
nerves
of
the
courtiers
by
nature
ascetic
he
hated
dissipation
moreover
his
family
life
was
by
no
means
happy
his
wife
ambitious
fond
of
luxury
and
pleasure
was
unable
to
share
his
pursuits
and
tastes
and
worried
her
husband
with
childish
complaints
of
loss
of
prestige
at
the
new
court
consequently
the
blunt
old
soldier
was
only
too
glad
to
leave
her
at
his
hotel
in
paris
and
bury
himself
in
his
estate
in
the
country
where
field
sports
offered
him
a
recreation
he
could
appreciate
and
his
old
comrades
and
country
neighbours
afforded
him
a
society
at
least
congenial

from
this
peaceful
life
at
coudreaux
the
marshal
was
suddenly
summoned
on
march
6
1815
to
paris
on
arriving
there
he
was
met
by
his
lawyer
who
informed
him
of
napoleons
descent
on
fréjus
it
is
a
great
misfortune
he
said
what
is
the
government
doing
who
are
they
going
to
send
against
that
man
then
he
hurried
off
to
the
minister
of
war
to
receive
his
instructions
he
was
ordered
to
besançon
to
take
command
of
the
troops
there
and
to
help
oppose
napoleons
advance
on
paris
before
starting
for
his
headquarters
he
went
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
king
and
expressed
his
indignation
at
the
emperors
action
promising
to
bring
him
back
in
an
iron
cage
on
arriving
at
his
command
he
found
everything
in
confusion
and
the
soldiers
ready
at
any
moment
to
declare
for
the
emperor
ney
had
but
one
thought
and
that
to
save
the
king
in
reply
to
a
friend
who
told
him
that
the
soldiers
could
not
fight
the
emperor
he
replied
they
shall
fight
i
will
begin
the
action
myself
and
run
my
sword
to
the
hilt
in
the
breast
of
the
first
who
hesitates
to
follow
my
example
but
when
he
arrived
on
the
evening
of
the
13th
at
lons
la
saulnier
he
was
met
by
the
news
that
on
all
sides
the
troops
were
deserting
and
that
the
duke
of
orleans
and
monsieur
had
been
compelled
to
withdraw
from
lyons
that
same
evening
emissaries
arrived
from
napoleon
alleging
that
all
the
marshals
had
promised
to
go
over
and
that
the
congress
of
vienna
had
approved
of
the
overthrow
of
the
bourbons
assuring
the
marshal
that
the
emperor
would
receive
him
as
on
the
day
after
the
battle
of
moskowa
while
but
half
convinced
by
these
specious
arguments
and
a
prey
to
doubt
news
arrived
that
his
vanguard
at
bourg
had
deserted
and
that
the
inhabitants
of
châlonssursaône
had
seized
his
artillery
in
his
agony
he
exclaimed
to
the
emissaries
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
stop
the
water
of
the
ocean
with
my
own
hand
on
the
morrow
he
called
the
generals
of
division
to
give
him
counsel
one
of
them
was
bourmont
a
doubledyed
traitor
who
deserted
napoleon
on
the
eve
of
waterloo
the
other
was
the
stern
old
republican
warrior
lecourbe
they
could
give
him
but
little
advice
so
at
last
the
fatal
decision
was
made
and
ney
called
his
troops
together
and
read
the
proclamation
drawn
up
by
napoleon

scarcely
had
he
done
so
than
he
began
to
perceive
the
enormity
of
his
action
meanwhile
he
wrote
an
impassioned
letter
to
napoleon
urging
him
to
seek
no
more
wars
of
conquest
it
might
suit
the
emperors
policy
to
cause
the
marshal
to
desert
those
to
whom
he
had
sworn
allegiance
but
he
mistrusted
men
who
broke
their
word
and
though
he
received
ney
with
outward
cordiality
he
saw
but
little
of
the
black
beast
as
he
called
him
during
the
hundred
days
for
the
duke
of
elchingen
full
of
remorse
and
shame
hid
himself
at
coudreaux
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
may
that
napoleon
summoned
him
to
paris
and
greeted
him
with
the
words
i
thought
you
had
become
an
émigré
i
ought
to
have
done
it
long
ago
replied
the
marshal
now
it
is
too
late
still
the
emperor
kept
him
without
employment
till
on
june
11th
he
sent
him
to
inspect
the
troops
around
lille
and
from
there
summoned
him
to
join
the
army
before
charleroi
on
the
afternoon
of
june
15th
immediately
on
his
arrival
he
was
put
in
command
of
the
left
wing
of
the
army
composed
of
reille
and
derlons
corps
and
received
verbal
orders
to
push
northwards
and
occupy
quatre
bras
the
marshals
task
was
not
an
enviable
one
he
had
to
improvise
a
staff
and
make
himself
acquainted
with
his
subordinates
and
at
the
same
time
try
and
elucidate
the
contradictory
orders
of
his
old
enemy
soult
now
chief
of
the
staff
to
the
emperor
accordingly
when
on
the
evening
of
the
15th
his
advance
guard
found
quatre
bras
held
by
the
enemy
he
decided
to
make
no
attack
that
night
but
on
the
morning
of
the
16th
he
made
a
still
greater
error
for
not
only
did
he
neglect
to
make
a
reconnaissance
which
would
have
showed
him
that
he
was
opposed
by
a
mere
handful
of
troops
but
slothful
as
ever
he
omitted
to
give
orders
for
the
proper
concentration
of
his
divisions
which
were
strung
out
along
sixteen
miles
of
road
a
day
begun
thus
badly
was
bound
to
bring
difficulties
but
these
difficulties
were
enormously
increased
in
the
afternoon
after
three
despatches
ordering
him
to
carry
quatre
bras
with
all
his
force
he
received
a
fourth
written
by
soult
at
napoleons
order
telling
him
to
move
to
the
right
to
support
grouchy
in
his
attack
on
the
prussians
ending
with
the
words
the
fate
of
france
is
in
your
hands
therefore
do
not
hesitate
to
move
according
to
the
emperors
commands
to
add
further
to
his
difficulties
derlons
corps
was
detached
from
his
command
without
his
knowledge
in
this
distracted
condition
the
marshal
lost
all
control
over
himself
calling
out
ah
those
english
balls
i
wish
they
were
all
in
my
belly
thus
it
was
mad
with
rage
that
he
rode
up
to
kellermann
calling
out
we
must
make
a
supreme
effort
take
your
cavalry
and
fling
yourself
upon
the
english
centre
crush
themride
them
down
but
it
was
too
late
wellington
himself
with
thirty
thousand
men
now
held
quatre
bras
the
marshal
had
himself
to
thank
for
his
want
of
success
for
if
he
had
been
less
slothful
in
the
morning
the
battle
would
have
been
won
before
the
contradictory
orders
could
have
had
any
effect
on
his
plans
on
the
morning
of
the
17th
the
dispirited
prince
of
moskowa
took
no
steps
to
find
out
what
his
enemy
was
doing
although
he
received
orders
from
the
emperor
at
ten
oclock
to
occupy
quatre
bras
if
there
was
only
a
rear
guard
there
accordingly
the
english
had
ample
time
to
retreat
when
napoleon
hurried
up
in
pursuit
at
2
pm
he
greeted
his
lieutenant
with
the
bitter
reproach
you
have
ruined
france
but
though
the
emperor
recognised
that
he
was
no
longer
the
ney
of
former
days
he
still
retained
him
in
his
command
at
waterloo
the
marshal
showed
his
old
dash
on
the
battlefield
the
left
wing
was
hurled
against
the
allies
with
a
vehemence
that
recalled
the
prince
of
moskowas
conduct
in
the
russian
campaign
but
impetuous
as
ever
finding
he
could
not
crush
the
stubborn
foe
with
his
infantry
he
rushed
back
and
prematurely
ordered
up
5000
of
the
cavalry
of
the
guard
he
has
compromised
us
again
growled
his
old
enemy
soult
as
he
did
at
jena
it
is
too
early
by
an
hour
exclaimed
the
emperor
but
we
must
support
him
now
that
he
has
done
it
the
mistake
was
fatal
to
napoleons
plans
in
vain
the
french
cavalry
charged
the
english
squares
still
unshaken
by
artillery
and
infantry
fire
meanwhile
the
prussians
appeared
on
the
allied
left
the
emperor
staked
his
last
card
and
ordered
the
guard
to
make
one
last
effort
to
crush
the
english
infantry
sword
in
hand
the
gallant
prince
of
moskowa
led
the
magnificent
veterans
to
the
attack
but
the
fire
of
the
english
lines
swept
them
down
by
hundreds
a
shout
arose
la
garde
recule
ney
the
indomitable
in
vain
seeking
death
was
swept
away
by
the
mass
his
clothing
in
rags
foaming
at
the
mouth
his
broken
sword
in
his
hand
rushing
from
corps
to
corps
trying
to
rally
the
runaways
with
taunts
of
cowards
have
you
forgotten
how
to
die
at
one
moment
he
passed
derlon
as
they
were
swept
along
in
the
rush
and
screamed
out
to
him
if
you
and
i
come
out
of
this
alive
derlon
we
shall
be
hanged
well
it
had
been
for
him
if
he
could
have
found
the
death
he
so
eagerly
sought
five
horses
were
shot
under
him
his
clothes
were
riddled
with
bullets
but
he
was
reserved
for
a
sinister
fate

the
marshal
returned
to
paris
and
witnessed
the
capitulation
and
second
abdication
thereafter
he
had
thoughts
of
withdrawing
to
switzerland
or
to
america
but
unfortunately
he
considered
himself
safe
under
the
terms
of
the
capitulation
and
anxious
to
clear
his
name
for
the
sake
of
his
children
he
remained
hidden
at
the
château
of
bessonis
near
aurillac
waiting
to
see
what
the
attitude
of
the
government
would
be
there
he
was
discovered
by
a
zealous
police
official
who
caught
sight
of
the
egyptian
sabre
napoleon
had
presented
to
him
in
1801
he
was
at
once
arrested
and
taken
to
paris
the
military
court
appointed
to
try
him
declared
itself
unable
to
try
a
peer
of
france
accordingly
the
house
of
peers
was
ordered
to
proceed
with
his
trial
and
found
him
guilty
by
a
majority
of
one
hundred
and
sixtynine
to
nineteen
the
marshals
lawyers
tried
to
get
him
off
by
the
subterfuge
that
he
was
no
longer
a
frenchman
since
his
native
town
sarrelouis
had
been
taken
from
france
but
ney
would
hear
of
no
such
excuse
i
am
a
frenchman
he
cried
and
will
die
a
frenchman
early
on
the
following
day
december
7
1815
the
sentence
was
read
to
the
prisoner
the
officer
entrusted
with
this
melancholy
duty
commenced
to
read
his
titles
prince
of
moskowa
duke
of
elchingen
c
but
the
marshal
cut
him
short
why
cannot
you
simply
say
michel
ney
once
a
french
soldier
and
soon
to
be
a
heap
of
dust
at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
the
marshal
with
a
firm
step
was
conveyed
to
the
place
of
execution
to
the
officer
who
prepared
to
bandage
his
eyes
he
said
are
you
ignorant
that
for
twentyfive
years
i
have
been
accustomed
to
face
both
ball
and
bullet
then
taking
off
his
hat
he
said
i
declare
before
god
and
man
that
i
have
never
betrayed
my
country
may
my
death
render
her
happy
vive
la
france
then
turning
to
the
soldiers
he
gave
the
word
soldiers
fire

thus
in
his
fortyseventh
year
the
prince
of
moskowa
a
peasants
son
but
now
immortal
as
the
bravest
of
the
brave
expiated
his
error
pity
it
was
that
he
had
not
the
courage
of
his
gallant
subordinate
at

who
had
broken
his
sword
in
pieces
with
the
words
it
is
easier
for
a
man
of
honour
to
break
iron
than
to
infringe
his
word
looking
backward
and
calmly
reading
the
evidence
of
the
trial
it
is
clear
that
ney
set
out
in
march
1815
with
every
intention
to
remain
faithful
to
the
king
but
his
moral
courage
failed
him
and
the
glamour
of
his
old
life
and
the
contact
with
the
iron
will
of
the
great
corsican
broke
down
his
principles
to
some
the
punishment
meted
out
to
him
seemed
hard
but
when
the
emperor
heard
of
his
execution
he
said
that
he
only
got
his
deserts
no
one
should
break
his
word
i
despise
traitors
ney
has
dishonoured
himself
and
the
duke
of
wellington
refused
to
plead
for
the
marshal
for
he
said
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
make
an
example
but
the
clearest
proof
of
the
justice
of
the
penalty
was
the
fact
that
from
the
fatal
day
at
lons
la
saulnier
the
marshal
was
never
himself
again
and
he
who
during
those
terrible
days
in
russia
had
been
able
to
sleep
like
a
little
child
never
could
sleep
in
peace

among
the
marshals
of
napoleon
ney
with
his
title
of
the
bravest
of
the
brave
and
his
magnificent
record
of
hard
fighting
will
always
appeal
to
those
who
love

great
fighter
as
he
was
he
was
not
a

general
at
times
at
st

napoleon
remembering
his
mistakes
at
quatre
bras
and
waterloo
used
to
say
that
he
ought
not
to
have
made
him
a
marshal
for
he
only
had
the
courage
and
honesty
of
a
hussar
forgetting
his
words
in

i
have
three
hundred
millions
francs
in
my
coffers
at
the
tuileries
i
would
willingly
have
given
them
to
save
marshal
ney
but
cruel
as
it
may
seem
perhaps
the
emperor
expressed
his
real
opinion
of
him
when
he
said
he
was
precious
on
the
battlefield
but
too
immoral
and
too
stupid
to
succeed
in
action
he
was
always
master
of
himself
but
as
jomini
his
old
chief
of
the
staff
wrote
of
him
neys
best
qualities
his
heroic
valour
his
rapid
coup
doeil
and
his
energy
diminished
in
the
same
proportion
that
the
extent
of
his
command
increased
his
responsibility
admirable
on
the
battlefield
he
displayed
less
assurance
not
only
in
council
but
whenever
he
was
not
actually
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
in
a
word
he
lacked
that
marked
intellectual
capacity
which
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
great
soldiers
like

napoleon
and
wellington




viii

louis
nicolas
davout
marshal
duke
of
auerstädt
prince
of
eckmühl


there
was
an
old
saying
in
burgundy
that
when
a
davout
comes
into
the
world
another
sword
has
leaped
from
the
scabbard
but
so
finely
tempered
a
weapon
as
louis
nicolas
had
never
before
been
produced
by
the
warrior
nobles
of
annoux
though
the
line
stretched
back
in
unbroken
descent
to
the
days
of
the
first
crusades
born
at
auxerre
on
may
18
1770
the
future
marshal
was
destined
for
the
service
and
at
the
age
of
fifteen
entered
the
royal
military
school
at
paris
in
the
fatal
year
1789
he
received
his
commission
in
the
royal
champagne
regiment
of
cavalry
stationed
at
hesdin
but
his
period
of
service
with
the
royal
army
was
short
from
his
boyhood
young
davout
was
one
of
those
whom
it
was
impossible
to
drive
who
while
they
submit
to
no
authority
are
as
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
master
mind
who
can
gain
their
affections
his
turbulent
spirit
had
early
become
captivated
by
the
specious
revolutionary
logic
of
a
brilliant
young
lawyer
turreau
who
a
few
years
later
became
his
stepfather
full
of
burning
zeal
for
his
new
political
tenets
chafing
under
the
dull
routine
of
garrison
life
despising
his
mediocre
companions
the
young
sublieutenant
soon
found
himself
in
trouble
and
was
dismissed
from
the
service
for
the
part
he
took
in
aiding
the
revolutionaries
in
their
attempts
to
seduce
the
privates
and
noncommissioned
officers
from
their
allegiance
to
their
sovereign
his
return
to
civil
life
was
but
brief
for
when
in
1791
the
prussian
invasion
summoned
the
country
to
arms
louis
nicolas
enlisted
in
the
volunteers
of
the
yonne
and
owing
to
his
former
military
training
was
at
once
elected
lieutenantcolonel

the
volunteers
of
the
yonne
formed
part
of
the
corps
opposed
to
the
austrians
in
the
low
countries
and
owing
to
the
stern
discipline
of
their
lieutenantcolonel
became
distinguished
as
the
most
reliable
of
all
the
volunteers
raised
in
1791
davout
adopted
the
same
plan
which
proved
so
effective
among
the
scotch
regiments
during
the
eighteenth
century
keeping
in
close
communication
with
the
local
authorities
of
the
yonne
and
rewarding
or
punishing
his
men
by
posting
their
names
with
their
records
in
the
various
cantons
from
which
they
were
drawn
after
fighting
bravely
under
dumouriez
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
battalion
to
attempt
to
capture
that
general
when
after
the
battle
of
neerwinden
he
tried
to
betray
his
army
to
the
austrians
soon
after
this
the
lieutenantcolonel
had
to
throw
up
his
command
when
the
convention
decreed
that
no
cidevant
noble
could
hold
a
commission
but
davouts
record
was
so
strongly
republican
that
his
friend
turreau
had
little
difficulty
in
getting
him
reinstated
in
his
rank
and
sent
to
command
a
brigade
of
cavalry
in
the
army
of
the
moselle
except
for
two
years
during
which
he
was
at
home
on
parole
after
the
capture
of
mannheim
the
general
was
on
active
service
in
the
rhine
valley
till
the
peace
of
campo
formio
in
1797
during
these
years
he
steadily
added
to
his
reputation
as
a
stern
commander
and
a
stubborn
fighter
and
as
such
attracted
the
attention
of
desaix
who
introduced
him
early
in
1798
to
bonaparte
the
future
emperor
saw
at
a
glance
that
this
small
stout
baldheaded
young
man
had
qualities
which
few
others
possessed
accordingly
he
took
him
with
him
to
egypt
like
all
who
met
the
young
napoleon
davout
fell
entirely
beneath
his
spell
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
included
among
the
few
friends
whom
bonaparte
selected
to
return
with
him
in
1800
his
enthusiasm
for
the
first
consul
increased
day
by
day
returning
to
france
with
desaix
just
before
the
marengo
campaign
he
at
once
hastened
to
paris
to
congratulate
the
new
head
of
the
government
davouts
republicanism
had
received
many
shocks
like
all
other
honourable
men
he
had
hated
and
loathed
the
terror
moreover
he
had
seen
on
service
how
little
the
preachers
of
the
equality
of
man
carried
out
their
doctrine
in
practice
as
early
as
1794
we
find
him
writing
to
a
friend
ought
we
to
be
exposed
to
the
tyranny
of
any
chance
revolutionary
committee
or
club
why
are
not
all
frenchmen
witnesses
of
fraternity
and
of
the
republican
virtues
which
reign
in
our
camps
we
have
no
brigands
here
but
have
we
not
plenty
at
home
bonaparte
knew
well
that
davout
was
not
only
his
enthusiastic
personal
follower
but
also
thoroughly
approved
of
the
coup
détat
of
the
18th
brumaire
and
in
his
desire
for
peace
and
stability
at
home
would
warmly
back
him
up
in
his
scheme
of
founding
a
tyranny
under
the
guise
of
an
imperial
republic
accordingly
the
first
consul
published
a
most
flattering
account
of
him
in
the
official
moniteur
and
gave
him
command
of
the
cavalry
of
the
army
of
italy
under
general
brune
in
june
1801
after
the
treaty
of
lüneville
in
pursuance
of
his
plan
of
congregating
his
friends
at
headquarters
he
recalled
him
to
paris
as
inspectorgeneral
of
cavalry

it
was
while
thus
employed
that
davout
met
his
wife
aimée
leclerc
aimée
a
sister
of
that
leclerc
who
married
pauline
bonaparte
had
been
educated
at
madame
campans
school
in
paris
along
with
the
young
beauharnais
and
bonapartes
and
was
the
bosom
friend
of
caroline
and
hortense
from
many
points
of
view
the
marriage
was
extremely
appropriate
for
although
the
davouts
belonged
to
the
old
nobility
and
aimées
father
was
only
a
corn
merchant
of
poitou
he
had
prospered
in
his
business
and
had
been
able
to
give
his
daughter
an
excellent
education
the
marriage
brought
davout
into
close
connection
with
the
first
consuls
family
and
was
successful
from
a
worldly
and
a
domestic
point
of
view
the
future
marshal
was
deeply
attached
to
his
wife
and
spent
every
moment
with
her
which
he
could
snatch
from
his
military
duties
when
absent
on
service
scarcely
a
day
passed
on
which
he
did
not
write
to
her
and
his
happiness
was
completely
bound
up
in
her
welfare
and
that
of
his
large
family
the
year
following
their
marriage
the
davouts
bought
the
beautiful
estate
of
savignysurorge
for
the
sum
of
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
this
was
a
great
strain
on
their
rather
limited
resources
and
for
some
years
they
had
to
practise
strict
economy

in
september
1803
the
general
was
summoned
to
bruges
to
command
a
corps
of
the
army
of
the
ocean
which
later
became
the
third
corps
of
the
grand
army
there
in
close
communication
with
his
great
chief
he
began
to
show
those
traits
which
made
him
respected
as
the
most
relentless
and
careful
administrator
of
all
the
marshals
of
france
his
energy
was
indefatigable
everything
had
to
undergo
his
personal
scrutiny
be
it
the
best
means
of
securing
the
embarkation
of
a
company
in
one
of
the
new
barges
or
the
careful
inspection
of
the
boots
of
a
battalion
for
davout
like
wellington
knew
that
a
soldiers
marching
powers
depended
on
two
things
his
feet
and
his
stomach
and
every
man
in
the
third
corps
had
to
have
two
pairs
of
good
boots
in
his
valise
and
one
on
his
feet
secrecy
also
in
his
eyes
was
of
prime
importance
he
was
quick
to
give
a
lesson
to
all
spies
or
wouldbe
spies
in
belgium
and
it
was
with
stern
exultation
in
his
duty
that
he
wrote
to
the
first
consul
your
orders
for
the
trial
of
the
spy
bülow
will
be
carried
out
and
within
a
week
he
will
be
executed
day
by
day
as
he
gained
experience
the
indefatigable
soldier
drew
on
him
the
approbation
of
the
first
consul
and
it
was
with
no
sense
of
favouritism
that
napoleon
when
he
became
emperor
nominated
him
among
his
newlycreated
marshals
although
in
the
eyes
of
the
army
at
large
he
had
not
yet
done
enough
to
justify
this
choice

the
campaign
of
1805
gave
the
marshal
his
first
opportunity
of
handling
large
bodies
of
troops
of
all
arms
in
the
field
and
though
it
did
not
bring
him
into
such
conspicuous
notice
as
murat
lannes
soult
and
ney
it
justified
napoleon
in
his
selection
of
him
as
worthy
of
the
marshals
bâton
in
the
operations
round
ulm
davout
proved
himself
an
excellent
subordinate
whose
corps
was
ever
ready
at
full
strength
in
the
field
and
at
the
hour
at
which
it
had
been
ordered
while
the
marshals
stern
checking
of
marauding
was
a
new
feature
in
french
military
discipline
and
one
which
no
other
marshal
could
successfully
carry
out
without
starving
his
troops
but
it
was
austerlitz
which
taught
the
students
of
war
the
true
capabilities
of
this
rising
officer
there
the
emperor
relying
on
his
stubborn
methodical
character
entrusted
him
with
a
duty
which
eminently
suited
his
genius
he
chose
his
corps
as
the
screen
to
cover
the
trap
which
he
set
for
the
russian
left
and
all
day
long
it
had
to
fight
a
stern
rearguard
action
against
overwhelming
odds
until
it
had
tempted
the
enemy
into
dissipating
his
forces
and
so
weakening
his
centre
that
his
left
and
right
were
defeated
in
detail
after
austerlitz
davout
was
entrusted
with
the
pursuit
of
the
left
wing
of
the
allies
flushed
with
victory
the
third
corps
pushed
the
disorganised
enemy
in
hopeless
rout
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
annihilation
of
the
russians
was
certain
meanwhile
unknown
to
the
marshal
the
emperor
had
accepted
the
czars
demands
for
an
armistice
davout
first
heard
of
the
cessation
of
hostilities
from
the
enemy
but
remembering
murats
mistake
he
refused
to
halt
his
troops
you
want
to
deceive
me
he
said
to
the
flag
of
truce
you
want
to
make
a
fool
of
me
i
am
going
to
crush
you
and
that
is
the
only
order
i
have
received
so
the
third
corps
pushed
on
and
it
was
only
the
production
of
a
despatch
in
the
handwriting
of
the
czar
himself
that
caused
the
victor
at
last
to
stay
his
hand

though
davout
emerged
from
the
austrian
campaign
with
the
reputation
in
the
army
of
having
at
last
earned
his
marshals
bâton
to
the
general
public
he
still
appeared
as
a
little
smoothpated
unpretending
man
who
was
never
tired
of
waltzing
but
the
campaign
of
1806
made
him
nearly
the
best
known
of
all
the
marshals
auerstädt
was
a
masterpiece
of
minor
tactics
napoleon
thinking
that
he
had
before
him
at
jena
the
whole
of
the
prussian
army
summoned
to
his
aid
bernadotte
and
thus
left
davout
with
a
force
of
twentythree
thousand
men
isolated
on
his
right
wing
with
orders
to
push
forward
and
try
to
get
astride
of
the
enemys
line
of
retreat

it
was
in
pursuance
of
this
order
that
early
in
the
morning
of
october
14
1806
the
marshal
at
the
head
of
the
advance
guard
of
his
corps
crossed
the
river
saale
at
kösen
and
proceeded
to
seize
the
defile
beyond
the
bridge
through
which
ran
the
road
to
naumberg
true
to
his
motto
of
never
leaving
to
another
anything
which
he
could
possibly
do
himself
he
had
personally
on
the
previous
evening
carefully
reconnoitred
the
line
of
advance
and
knew
the
importance
of
the
village
of
hassenhausen
at
the
further
end
of
the
defile
hardly
had
his
advance
guard
seized
this
position
and
the
heights
commanding
the
road
when
through
the
fog
they
saw
approaching
the
masses
of
the
enemys
cavalry
the
fiery
prussian
commander
blücher
at
once
hastened
to
the
attack
and
again
and
again
led
his
horsemen
to
the
charge
meanwhile
brunswick
counterordered
the
retreat
of
the
infantry
and
artillery
soon
the
whole
of
the
prussian
army
fortyfive
thousand
strong
was
engaged
in
the
attempt
to
crush
the
small
french
force
but
the
marshal
was
in
his
element
carefully
husbanding
his
resources
only
to
hurl
them
into
the
fray
at
the
critical
moment
feinting
at
his
enemys
flanks
utilising
every
feature
of
the
ground
to
prolong
his
resistance
galloping
from
square
to
square
his
uniform
black
from
powder
his
cocked
hat
carried
off
by
a
bullet
encouraging
his
troops
with
short
sharp
words
crying
out
the
great
frederick
believed
that
god
gave
the
victory
to
the
big
battalions
but
he
lied
it
is
the
obstinate
people
that
win
and
thats
you
and
your
general
from
six
in
the
morning
the
battle
raged
but
towards
midday
the
prussians
finding
that
they
could
make
no
impression
on
the
enemy
began
to
slacken
their
attack
davout
seized
the
psychological
moment
to
order
his
whole
line
to
advance
thereon
the
king
of
prussia
commanded
his
forces
to
retire
leaving
a
strong
rear
guard
under
kalkreuth
to
prevent
the
french
pursuit
but
the
french
were
in
no
condition
to
carry
on
an
active
pursuit
for
out
of
twentythree
thousand
men
engaged
they
had
lost
almost
eight
thousand
killed
or
wounded
it
is
quite
true
that
man
for
man
the
french
soldier
in
1806
was
superior
in
intelligence
and
patriotism
to
the
prussian
that
the
french
staff
was
infinitely
superior
to
the
prussian
staff
and
that
there
was
no
comparison
between
the
morale
of
the
two
armies
but
that
alone
does
not
explain
how
an
army
half
the
size
of
the
enemy
caught
as
it
was
in
the
act
of
deploying
from
a
defile
not
only
was
not
beaten
absolutely
but
actually
defeated
the
superior
force
the
secret
of
the
french
success
at
auerstädt
lay
in
the
character
of
their
general
it
was
davouts
careful
reconnaissance
his
quickness
to
perceive
in
hassenhausen
the
key
of
the
position
his
careful
crowning
of
the
heights
covering
the
defile
the
masterly
way
in
which
while
massing
his
men
in
the
open
to
resist
blüchers
fierce
charges
he
at
the
same
time
contrived
so
to
expand
his
line
as
to
threaten
the
flanks
of
his
vastly
superior
foe
his
indomitable
courage
in
throwing
his
last
reserve
into
the
firing
line
and
his
audacious
counterattack
the
moment
he
saw
the
prussians
wavering
which
saved
his
force
from
what
at
the
time
looked
like
annihilation
and
by
sheer
downright
courage
and
selfconfidence
turned
defeat
into
victory

pleased
as
the
emperor
was
at
his
lieutenants
victory
and
much
as
he
admired
the
way
in
which
his
subordinate
had
copied
his
own
methods
showing
that
inflexibility
of
purpose
absolute
disregard
of
the
opinion
of
others
and
unswerving
belief
in
his
own
capacity
which
he
knew
were
the
factors
of
his
own
success
it
did
not
suit
his
policy
that
a
subordinate
should
attract
the
admiration
of
the
army
at
large
accordingly
in
his
bulletins
he
glossed
over
the
part
played
by
davout
and
belittled
his
success
but
in
his
private
letters
he
warmly
praised
the
marshals
courage
and
ability
further
to
reward
him
for
lack
of
official
praise
he
gave
the
third
corps
the
place
of
honour
at
the
grand
march
past
held
at
berlin
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
capital
of
frederick
the
great
saw
for
the
first
time
with
mingled
hatred
and
surprise
the
lively
impudent
meanlooking
little
fellows
who
had
thrashed
their
own
magnificent
troops
on
the
following
day
the
emperor
inspected
the
third
corps
and
thanked
the
officers
and
men
for
the
great
services
they
had
rendered
him
and
paid
a
tribute
to
the
brave
men
i
have
lost
whom
i
regret
as
it
were
my
own
children
but
who
died
on
the
field
of
honour
pleased
as
the
marshal
was
with
this
somewhat
tardy
acknowledgment
of
his
achievement
he
was
in
no
way
inflated
with
pride
as
general
ségur
says
of
him
those
who
knew
him
best
say
that
there
was
a
sort
of
flavour
of
a
bygone
age
in
his
inflexibility
stern
towards
himself
and
towards
others
and
above
all
in
that
stoical
simplicity
high
above
all
vanity
with
which
he
ever
strode
forward
with
shoulders
square
and
full
intent
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
duty
but
though
success
brought
no
pride
in
its
train
it
brought
its
burdens
the
jealousy
of
the
other
marshals
was
barely
concealed
and
as
davout
wrote
to
his
wife
i
am
more
than
ever
in
need
of
the
emperors
goodwill

few
of
my
colleagues
pardon
me
the
good
fortune
the
third
corps
had
in
beating
the
king
of
prussia

a
winter
spent
in
poland
amid
these
jealousies
and
far
from
his
family
was
only
endurable
because
of
his
attachment
to
the
service
and
person
of
the
emperor
immediately
on
entering
the
country
which
he
was
to
govern
for
the
next
two
years
the
marshal
summed
up
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
told
the
emperor
that
the
nobility
would
throw
cold
water
on
all
schemes
unless
the
french
guaranteed
them
their
independence

with
the
spring
of
1807
came
the
last
phase
of
the
war
at
heilsberg
davout
fought
well
and
two
days
later
took
his
part
in
the
great
battle
of
eylau
the
most
bloody
of
all
napoleons
battles
bennigsen
the
russian
commander
had
turned
at
bay
on
his
pursuers
on
the
morning
of
february
8th
the
french
corps
came
hurrying
up
from
all
sides
at
the
emperors
commands
it
was
not
however
till
midday
that
the
third
corps
arrived
on
the
scene
of
the
action
heavy
snow
blizzards
obscured
the
scene
but
the
struggle
raged
fiercely
on
all
sides
the
russians
fighting
like
bulls
as
the
french
said
the
emperor
on
davouts
arrival
placed
his
corps
on
the
right
and
ordered
him
to
advance
but
the
enemys
cavalry
and
artillery
effectually
barred
his
way
all
day
long
the
contest
lasted
men
fighting
hand
to
hand
in
a
confused
mêlée
all
day
long
davout
with
obstinate
courage
clung
to
the
village
which
he
seized
in
the
morning
whence
he
threatened
the
russian
line
of
retreat
when
night
came
he
still
held
his
position
at
last
the
emperor
fearing
a
renewal
of
the
fight
on
the
next
day
gave
orders
at
eight
oclock
for
the
third
corps
to
fall
back
on
eylau
but
the
marshal
hearing
of
the
commencement
of
the
russian
retreat
disobeyed
the
emperor
and
thus
by
his
bold
front
in
conjunction
with
soult
he
was
mainly
instrumental
in
causing
the
enemy
to
leave
the
field
if
davout
had
been
less
obstinate
the
french
would
have
had
to
fight
another
battle
on
the
following
day
but
thanks
to
him
they
were
spared
this
fate
and
the
twentyfive
thousand
dead
and
wounded
frenchmen
had
not
spent
their
blood
in
vain
the
third
corps
escaped
the
horrors
of
friedland
as
it
had
been
detached
to
intercept
the
enemys
line
of
retreat
in
the
direction
of
königsberg
and
tilsit
saw
the
end
of
davouts
second
campaign
against
the
russians

but
peace
did
not
bring
the
opportunity
of
returning
to
his
beloved
france
and
the
joys
of
home
life
the
emperor
in
peace
as
in
war
could
not
spare
the
great
administrative
capacity
the
stern
discipline
and
the
rigid
probity
of
the
marshal
it
is
quite
fair
that
i
should
give
him
enormous
presents
said
the
emperor
for
he
takes
no
perquisites
so
davout
found
himself
established
nominally
as
commander
of
the
army
of
occupation
and
really
as
special
adviser
to
the
government
of
the
newly
constituted
grand
duchy
of
warsaw
it
was
a
situation
that
required
infinite
tact
patience
and
a
stern
will
the
poles
longed
for
a
restored
kingdom
of
poland
the
emperor
could
not
grant
this
without
offending
his
new
friend
the
czar
who
with
the
emperor
of
austria
looked
with
suspicion
on
the
experiment
of
creating
a
grand
duchy
so
on
one
side
the
marshal
had
to
try
to
inspire
confidence
in
the
poles
by
pretending
that
the
grand
duchy
was
merely
a
temporary
experiment
in
the
larger
policy
of
restoring
the
kingdom
while
on
the
other
hand
he
had
to
assure
the
austrians
and
russians
that
nothing
was
further
from
the
emperors
thoughts
than
creating
a
power
at
warsaw
dangerous
to
them
meanwhile
there
was
plenty
of
occupation
in
getting
provisions
for
his
troops
in
a
land
always
poor
and
but
lately
devastated
by
war
and
in
attempting
to
maintain
order
in
a
country
full
of
adventurers
where
police
were
unknown
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
get
assistance
from
the
government
for
there
was
no
organisation
no
division
of
duties
among
the
different
ministers
and
nobody
knew
what
his
own
particular
business
was
the
situation
was
well
summed
up
in
a
caricature
which
showed
the
ministers
nicely
dressed
in
their
various
uniforms
but
without
heads
it
was
well
for
the
new
government
that
they
had
at
their
side
such
a
stern
disinterested
adviser
as
davout
ready
to
take
the
initiative
and
accept
the
responsibility
of
any
act
which
he
thought
good
for
the
community
under
his
supervision
the
ministers
spheres
of
action
were
duly
arranged
the
state
was
saved
from
bankruptcy
by
importing
bullion
from
prussia
and
deporting
the
adventurers
who
were
filling
their
own
coffers
by
draining
the
money
from
the
country
the
monks
who
preached
against
the
government
and
fanned
popular
discontent
were
three
times
given
twentyfour
hours
notice
to
put
their
houses
in
order
and
then
quietly
escorted
across
the
frontier
a
strong
polish
force
was
raised
armed
and
equipped
by
prince
poniatowski
under
the
marshals
supervision
as
a
reward
for
his
labours
the
emperor
granted
davout
three
hundred
thousand
francs
to
buy
a
town
house
in
paris
and
followed
this
up
in
may
1808
by
creating
him
duke
of
auerstädt
but
what
pleased
the
marshal
more
than
all
was
that
the
emperor
allowed
the
duchess
to
join
him
at
warsaw
this
was
a
politic
move
for
the
emperor
knowing
well
the
secret
intention
of
austria
could
not
afford
to
withdraw
the
warden
of
the
marches
from
his
outpost
at
warsaw
but
by
sending
the
duchess
of
auerstädt
to
poland
he
kept
his
faithful
lieutenant
content
however
the
duchesss
visit
to
poland
was
not
a
long
one
by
september
1808
it
became
certain
that
austria
was
making
immense
efforts
to
recover
her
possessions
and
accordingly
napoleon
very
wisely
began
to
concentrate
his
troops
in
central
europe
and
the
duke
of
auerstädts
corps
was
recalled
to
silesia
in
october
and
was
incorporated
with
the
french
troops
in
prussia
under
the
designation
of
the
army
of
the
rhine

during
the
winter
the
marshal
was
fully
occupied
in
forcing
prussia
to
drain
to
the
last
dregs
her
cup
of
humiliation
extorting
from
her
the
immense
ransom
napoleon
had
laid
on
her
and
crushing
her
attempts
at
regeneration
by
hounding
out
of
the
country
the
patriotic
stein
and
his
band
of
fellowworkers
from
his
cantonments
round
berlin
davout
was
summoned
in
1809
to
take
part
in
another
struggle
with
austria
the
campaign
opened
disastrously
for
the
french
the
archduke
charles
commenced
operations
earlier
than
napoleon
had
calculated
and
accordingly
the
grand
army
found
itself
under
the
feeble
command
of
the
chief
of
the
staff
berthier
in
blind
obedience
to
the
emperor
who
had
misread
the
situation
was
compelled
to
neglect
the
first
principles
of
war
and
to
attempt
to
block
all
possible
lines
of
advance
instead
of
concentrating
in
a
strategic
position
in
consequence
of
this
the
duke
of
auerstädt
in
spite
of
his
official
protests
found
himself
at
ratisbon
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
army
with
no
support
within
forty
miles
from
this
dangerous
position
he
was
saved
by
the
arrival
of
the
emperor
at
headquarters
who
recognising
his
own
mistakes
immediately
ordered
a
concentration
on
abensberg
the
retreat
or
rather
the
flank
march
in
the
face
of
eighty
thousand
austrians
under
the
archduke
charles
was
successfully
carried
out
thanks
to
the
stubborn
fighting
of
the
troops
and
the
lucky
intervention
of
a
tremendous
thunderstorm
which
forced
the
enemy
to
give
up
their
attack
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
french
were
crossing
a
difficult
defile
two
days
later
the
emperor
once
again
tested
davouts
stubborn
qualities
entrusting
him
with
the
duty
of
containing
the
main
austrian
force
while
he
disposed
of
the
rest
of
the
enemy
the
result
was
the
three
days
fighting
at
eckmühl
during
the
first
two
davout
unaided
held
his
own
till
on
the
third
the
emperor
arrived
with
supports
and
gave
the
austrians
the
coupdegrâce
but
rewarded
the
marshal
for
his
tenacity
by
bestowing
on
him
the
title
of
prince
of
eckmühl

though
his
corps
was
not
actually
engaged
at
the
battle
of
aspernessling
the
marshal
had
a
large
share
in
preventing
a
complete
catastrophe
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
breaking
of
the
bridge
he
set
about
to
organise
a
flotilla
of
boats
and
it
was
thanks
to
the
supplies
of
ammunition
thus
ferried
across
that
the
french
troops
on
the
north
bank
were
able
to
hold
their
own
and
cover
the
retreat
to
the
isle
of
lobau
while
both
sides
were
concentrating
every
available
man
for
the
great
battle
of
wagram
davout
was
entrusted
with
the
task
of
watching
the
archduke
john
whose
army
at
pressburg
was
the
rallying
point
for
the
hungarians
the
moment
the
french
preparations
were
complete
the
marshal
leaving
a
strong
screen
in
front
of
the
archduke
swiftly
fell
back
on
the
isle
of
lobau
and
by
thus
hoodwinking
the
archduke
gave
the
emperor
an
advantage
of
fifty
thousand
troops
over
the
enemy
the
prince
of
eckmühls
duty
at
the
battle
of
wagram
was
to
turn
the
left
flank
of
the
enemy
and
while
interposing
his
corps
between
the
two
archdukes
at
the
same
time
to
threaten
the
enemys
rear
and
give
an
opportunity
to
the
french
centre
to
drive
home
a
successful
attack
it
was
a
most
difficult
and
dangerous
operation
for
at
any
moment
the
archduke
john
might
appear
on
the
exposed
right
flank
whilst
davout
was
marching
and
fighting
to
achieve
his
purpose
the
main
battle
went
against
the
french
the
left
and
centre
were
thrown
back
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
austrians
were
bound
to
capture
the
bridge
at
enzerdorff
amid
cries
of
all
is
lost
the
french
reserve
artillery
and
baggage
trains
fled
in
confusion
but
relief
came
at
the
critical
moment
for
the
prince
of
eckmühl
hurling
his
steelclad
cuirassiers
on
the
unbroken
austrian
foot
losing
nearly
all
his
generals
in
the
desperate
handtohand
fighting
on
the
slopes
of
the
neusiedel
at
last
gained
the
top
of
the
plateau
and
forced
the
enemy
to
throw
back
his
left
flank
and
weaken
his
centre
the
moment
the
emperor
saw
the
guns
appear
on
the
summit
of
the
neusiedel
he
launched
macdonalds
corps
against
the
austrian
centre
and
sent
his
aidedecamp
to
masséna
to
tell
him
to
commence
the
attack

the
battle
is
gained
but
davout
was
unable
to
pursue
his
advantage
over
the
enemys
left
for
at
the
moment
he
gained
the
top
of
the
plateau
news
arrived
that
prince
johns
advance
guard
was
in
touch
with
his
scouts
accordingly
he
halted
and
drew
up
in
battle
formation
ready
at
any
moment
to
face
the
hungarian
troops
should
they
attempt
to
attack
his
rear
fortunately
for
the
french
the
archduke
john
forgot
that
an
enemy
is
never
so
weak
as
after
a
successful
attack
and
instead
of
hurling
his
fresh
troops
on
the
weakened
and
disorganised
french
he
halted
and
withdrew
after
dark
towards
pressburg
when
during
the
pursuit
of
the
battle
the
archduke
charles
sent
in
a
flag
of
truce
offering
to
discuss
terms
the
emperor
called
a
council
of
war
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
difference
of
opinion
but
davout
was
for
continuing
the
fight
pointing
out
that
once
master
of
the
road
from
brünn
in
two
hours
it
would
be
possible
to
concentrate
thirty
thousand
men
across
the
archdukes
line
of
retreat
the
marshals
arguments
seemed
about
to
prevail
when
news
arrived
that
bruyère
commanding
the
cavalry
was
seriously
wounded
thereon
the
emperor
changed
his
mind
crying
out
look
at
it
death
hovers
over
all
my
generals
who
knows
but
that
within
two
hours
i
shall
not
hear
that
you
are
taken
off
no
enough
blood
has
been
spilled
i
accept
the
suspension
of
hostilities

after
the
evacuation
of
the
conquered
territories
the
marshal
was
appointed
to
command
the
army
of
germany
his
duties
were
to
enforce
the
continental
system
and
to
keep
a
stern
eye
on
prussia
the
marriage
with
marie
louise
for
the
time
being
relieved
tension
in
central
europe
and
accordingly
in
1810
davout
was
able
to
enjoy
long
periods
of
leave
he
was
present
as
colonelgeneral
of
the
guard
at
the
imperial
wedding
and
at
the
interment
of
lanness
remains
in
the
panthéon
and
he
did
his
turn
of
duty
as
general
in
attendance
on
the
imperial
household
his
letters
to
his
wife
throw
an
interesting
light
on
the
imperial
ménage
the
officers
in
attendance
were
supplied
with
good
comfortable
rooms
and
food
but
had
to
find
their
own
linen
plates
wax
candles
firewood
and
kitchen
utensils
in
a
postscript
he
adds
not
only
must
you
send
me
all
the
above
but
add
towels
sheets
pillowcases
c
until
these
arrive
i
have
to
sleep
on
the
bare
mattress

in
1811
the
growing
hostility
of
russia
required
the
attendance
of
the
prince
of
eckmühl
at
the
headquarters
of
his
command
napoleon
knew
well
that
nobody
would
be
quicker
to
discern
any
secret
movement
hostile
to
his
interests
than
the
man
who
in
1808
had
done
so
much
to
check
the
regeneration
of
prussia
by
enforcing
his
orders
playing
on
the
prussian
kings
fears
and
exposing
the
cleverness
of
the
proposals
of
the
patriotic
stein
the
marshal
reached
his
headquarters
at
hamburg
early
in
february
and
soon
found
his
hands
full
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
so
disposing
the
corps
committed
to
his
care
that
he
might
cripple
the
english
who
since
the
time
of
cromwell
have
played
the
game
of
ruining
our
commerce
but
of
preparing
a
mixed
force
of
french
poles
and
saxons
amounting
to
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
for
the
contingencies
of
a
war
with
russia
or
for
the
absolute
annihilation
of
prussia
to
no
other
of
his
marshals
did
the
emperor
entrust
the
command
of
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
troops
and
consequently
the
old
enmities
and
jealousies
broke
out
with
renewed
force
it
was
whispered
that
the
marshals
income
from
his
investments
pay
and
perquisites
was
over
two
million
francs
a
year
that
nobody
in
the
imperial
family
had
anything
like
as
much
and
people
said
it
was
better
to
be
a
davout
than
a
prince
royal
the
prince
disregarded
all
the
annoying
scandal
his
wife
sent
him
from
paris
and
quietly
busied
himself
with
preparing
transport
and
equipping
magazines
for
the
coming
war
diversified
by
an
occasional
thundering
declaration
informing
the
king
of
prussia
that
his
secret
schemes
were
well
known
to
the
french
authorities
but
the
subterranean
jealousies
bore
their
fruit
nobody
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
davout
and
there
was
nobody
to
take
his
part
most
disastrously
for
the
grand
army
the
misunderstanding
which
existed
between
berthier
and
davout
prevented
their
cooperation
and
thus
during
the
russian
campaign
the
rash
emptyheaded
murat
had
greater
weight
with
napoleon
than
davout
the
cautious
yet
tenacious
old
fighter
accordingly
at
the
battle
of
moskowa
when
napoleon
had
his
last
chance
of
annihilating
the
russians
he
refused
to
listen
to
the
marshal
who
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
turn
the
russian
left
during
the
night
no
said
the
emperor
it
is
too
big
a
movement
it
will
take
me
too
much
off
my
objective
and
make
me
lose
time
davout
sure
of
the
wisdom
of
this
advice
once
again
renewed
his
arguments
but
the
emperor
rudely
interrupted
him
with
you
are
always
for
turning
the
enemy
it
is
too
dangerous
a
movement
so
the
battle
of
moskowa
was
a
disastrous
victory
opening
as
it
did
the
gates
of
moscow
without
the
annihilation
of
the
russian
armed
forces
in
the
field
but
it
was
greatly
due
to
the
marshal
that
it
was
a
victory
at
all
for
the
russians
fought
with
the
greatest
stubbornness
nearly
all
the
french
generals
were
wounded
or
killed
and
at
one
moment
a
panic
seized
the
troops
then
it
was
that
the
prince
of
eckmühl
himself
rallied
the
broken
battalions
and
led
them
to
the
charge
in
spite
of
a
wound
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
with
bare
head
and
uniform
encrusted
with
mud
and
blood
he
forced
his
weary
soldiers
against
the
foe
and
as
at
auerstädt
by
sheer
indomitable
courage
compelled
his
troops
to
beat
the
enemy
his
corps
bore
its
share
in
the
horrors
of
the
retreat
from
moscow
forming
for
some
time
the
rear
guard

when
napoleon
deserted
the
relics
of
the
grand
army
at
vilma
the
marshals
difficulties
naturally
increased
for
his
enemy
murat
was
now
in
command
and
as
he
wrote
to
his
wife
earlier
in
the
campaign
i
am
worth
ten
times
as
much
when
the
emperor
is
present
for
he
alone
can
put
order
into
this
great
complicated
machine
but
the
king
of
naples
did
not
long
retain
his
command
he
had
not
davouts
confidence
in
napoleon
and
was
disgusted
with
the
illsuccess
of
the
campaign
and
afraid
of
losing
his
crown
the
marshal
ever
loyal
to
the
emperor
would
listen
to
none
of
the
gascons
diatribes
and
told
him
plainly
you
are
only
king
by
the
grace
of
napoleon
and
by
the
blood
of
brave
frenchmen
you
can
only
remain
king
by
napoleons
aid
and
by
remaining
united
to
france
it
is
black
ingratitude
which
blinds
you
so
murat
went
off
to
italy
to
plan
treason
and
davout
returned
to
germany
to
place
his
life
and
reputation
at
the
emperors
service

it
fell
to
the
marshals
lot
in
1813
to
hold
northern
germany
as
part
of
the
plan
of
campaign
whereby
the
advance
of
the
allies
was
to
be
checked
the
emperor
had
determined
to
make
an
example
of
the
town
of
hamburg
to
teach
other
german
cities
the
fate
to
be
expected
by
those
who
deserted
him
his
orders
were
that
all
those
who
had
taken
any
share
in
the
desertion
were
to
be
arrested
and
their
goods
sequestrated
and
that
a
contribution
of
fifty
million
francs
was
to
be
paid
by
the
towns
of
lübeck
and
hamburg
the
marshal
carried
out
his
orders
hamburg
writhed
impotent
at
his
feet
and
the
heavy
arm
of
justice
fell
on
the
canaille
only
in
the
case
of
the
contribution
did
he
make
any
deviation
from
the
emperors
wishes
as
it
was
inexpedient
to
drive
all
the
wealthy
people
out
of
the
state
in
pursuance
of
the
emperors
plans
by
the
winter
of
1813
davout
had
made
hamburg
impregnable
he
had
laid
in
huge
supplies
and
built
a
bridge
of
wood
two
leagues
long
joining
haarburg
and
hamburg
with
a
garrison
of
thirty
thousand
men
danger
threatened
from
within
rather
than
from
without
for
napoleons
bitter
punishment
of
hamburg
ending
as
it
did
with
the
seizure
of
eight
million
marks
from
the
funds
of
the
city
bank
had
made
the
name
of
france
stink
in
the
nostrils
of
the
inhabitants
the
marshal
was
determined
to
hold
the
town
to
the
last
in
december
when
provisions
began
to
fail
the
poor
were
banished
from
the
city
those
who
refused
to
go
were
threatened
with
fifty
blows
of
the
cane
at
the
end
of
december
people
without
distinction
of
sex
or
age
were
dragged
from
their
beds
and
conveyed
out
of
the
town
during
the
siege
the
russian
commander
bennigsen
attempted
by
means
of
spies
and
proclamations
to
raise
a
rebellion
in
the
fortress
but
davouts
grip
was
too
firm
to
be
shaken
and
a
few
executions
cooled
the
ardour
of
the
spies
it
was
not
till
april
15th
that
the
marshal
was
informed
by
a
flag
of
truce
of
the
fall
of
the
empire
not
certain
of
the
truth
of
the
news
he
refused
to
give
up
his
command
at
last
on
april
28th
official
news
arrived
from
paris
and
on
the
following
day
the
fifteen
thousand
men
who
remained
of
the
original
garrison
of
thirty
thousand
swore
allegiance
to
the
bourbons
and
mounted
the
white
cockade

on
may
11th
general
gerard
arrived
to
relieve
davout
of
his
command
on
his
arrival
in
france
the
prince
of
eckmühl
found
himself
charged
with
having
fired
on
the
white
flag
after
being
informed
of
napoleons
abdication
of
appropriating
the
funds
of
the
bank
of
hamburg
and
of
committing
arbitrary
acts
which
caused
the
french
name
to
become
odious
his
reply
was
first
that
until
he
had
received
official
information
of
the
fall
of
the
empire
it
was
his
duty
to
take
measures
to
prevent
hamburg
being
surprised
that
the
appropriation
of
the
funds
of
the
bank
was
the
only
means
of
finding
money
to
hold
hamburg
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
continental
system
and
as
a
soldier
he
had
only
obeyed
commands
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
contrived
to
have
the
heavy
contribution
lightened
and
lastly
that
during
the
siege
he
had
only
had
two
spies
shot
and
one
french
soldier
executed
for
purloining
hospital
stores
but
in
spite
of
his
defence
and
the
prayers
of
his
fellow
marshals
louis
refused
to
allow
davout
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
accordingly
when
in
1815
napoleon
returned
from
elba
the
prince
of
eckmühl
alone
of
all
the
marshals
could
hasten
to
the
emperor
without
a
stain
on
his
honour

immediately
on
his
return
the
emperor
made
a
great
call
on
the
faithfulness
of
his
friend
and
told
him
he
had
chosen
him
as
minister
of
war
the
marshal
begged
for
service
in
the
field
but
the
emperor
was
firm
davout
alone
had
held
to
him
and
all
others
had
the
bourbon
taint
still
the
marshal
refused
pleading
his
brusque
manners
and
wellknown
harshness
but
at
last
the
emperor
appealed
to
his
pity
pointing
out
that
all
europe
was
against
him
and
asking
him
if
he
also
was
going
to
abandon
his
sovereign
thereon
the
marshal
accepted
the
post
it
was
no
light
burden
that
he
had
undertaken
prince
of
martinets
though
he
was
to
regenerate
an
army
scattered
to
the
winds
everything
was
lackingmen
horses
guns
transports
stores
and
ammunition
yet
he
worked
wonders
and
by
the
beginning
of
june
the
emperor
had
a
field
army
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
with
another
quarter
of
a
million
troops
in
formation
in
france
on
the
return
of
the
emperor
to
paris
after
the
disaster
at
waterloo
the
marshal
in
vain
besought
him
to
dissolve
the
assemblies
and
proclaim
a
dictatorship
but
napoleons
spirit
was
broken
and
the
favourable
moment
passed
by
meanwhile
the
emperor
remained
in
idleness
at
malmaison
and
by
the
28th
of
june
the
prussians
arrived
near
paris
with
the
intention
of
capturing
him
but
the
prince
of
eckmühl
warded
off
the
danger
by
barricading
or
burning
the
bridges
across
the
seine
and
manoeuvring
sixty
thousand
troops
in
front
of
blücher
thanks
to
this
napoleon
escaped
to
rochfort
and
owed
his
safety
to
davout
for
blücher
had
sworn
to
catch
him
dead
or
alive

on
the
evacuation
of
paris
the
marshal
withdrew
westwards
with
the
remnant
of
the
imperial
army
now
called
the
army
of
the
loire
but
as
soon
as
louis
had
once
again
ascended
the
throne
he
relieved
davout
making
gouvion
st
cyr
minister
of
war
and
macdonald
commander
of
the
army
of
the
loire
the
marshal
spent
some
months
in
exile
but
was
allowed
to
return
to
france
in
1816
however
the
mutual
distrust
between
him
and
the
bourbons
could
not
be
overcome
and
although
he
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
received
the
cross
of
st
louis
he
never
attempted
to
return
to
public
life
and
died
of
an
attack
of
pleurisy
on
june
1
1823

the
causes
of
the
success
of
the
prince
of
eckmühl
are
easy
to
ascertain
acute
perception
doggedness
of
purpose
and
a
devotion
which
never
faltered
or
failed
are
gifts
which
are
bound
to
bring
success
when
added
to
an
exceptional
run
of
good
fortune
among
the
marshals
there
were
many
no
doubt
who
had
as
quick
a
perception
and
as
vivid
an
imagination
as
davout
but
there
was
no
one
who
had
his
massive
doggedness
and
determination
and
bessières
alone
perhaps
surpassed
him
in
personal
devotion
to
the
emperor
much
as
we
may
see
to
blame
in
his
untiring
hounding
down
of
the
patriot
stein
in
prussia
in
his
cruel
exactions
in
hamburg
and
in
the
remorseless
way
he
treated
spies
and
deserters
we
must
remember
that
he
did
it
all
from
motives
of
patriotism
moreover
we
cannot
fail
to
admire
a
man
who
made
it
a
principle
when
he
had
received
rigorous
orders
to
accept
all
the
odium
arising
from
their
performance
because
he
considered
that
since
the
sovereign
is
permanent
and
the
officials
are
changeable
it
is
important
that
officials
should
brave
the
temporary
odium
of
measures
which
are
but
temporary
in
his
opinion
the
phrase
if
the
king
only
knew
was
a
precious
illusion
which
was
one
of
the
foundationstones
of
all
government
thus
it
was
that
in
carrying
out
severe
orders
the
marshal
never
attempted
to
shield
himself
behind
the
name
of
the
emperor

it
was
therefore
from
a
spirit
of
patriotism
as
the
servant
of
the
french
emperor
that
davout
pressed
relentlessly
on
those
who
tried
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
france
stern
as
his
nature
was
he
did
not
disguise
from
himself
that
his
policy
bore
hardly
on
the
conquered
for
when
napoleon
asked
him
how
would
you
behave
if
i
made
you
king
of
poland
he
replied
when
a
man
has
the
honour
to
be
a
frenchman
he
must
always
be
a
frenchman
but
he
added
from
the
day
on
which
i
accepted
the
crown
of
poland
i
would
become
entirely
and
solely
a
pole
and
i
would
act
in
complete
contradiction
to
your
majesty
if
the
interests
of
the
people
whose
chief
i
was
demanded
that
i
should
do
so
as
a
soldier
and
an
administrator
though
he
is
rightly
called
the
prince
of
martinets
yet
nothing
was
more
abhorrent
to
his
eyes
than
red
tape
efficiency
was
everything
and
efficiency
he
considered
was
only
to
be
gained
by
personal
inspection
of
detail
considered
in
relation
to
existing
conditions
and
not
by
blind
obedience
to
hard
and
fast
rules
it
was
this
habit
of
mind
and
readiness
for
all
contingencies
which
won
for
him
his
titles
of
duke
of
auerstädt
and
prince
of
eckmühl
and
made
him
the
righthand
man
of
the
great
emperor
who
confessed
that
if
i
am
always
prepared
it
is
because
before
entering
on
an
undertaking
i
have
meditated
for
long
and
foreseen
what
may
occur
it
is
not
genius
which
reveals
to
me
suddenly
and
secretly
what
i
should
do
in
circumstances
unforeseen
by
others
it
is
thought
and
meditation

of
tarentum


jacques
étienne
joseph
alexandre
macdonald
duke
of
tarentum
was
the
son
of
a
uist
crofter
macachaim
the
macachaims
of
uist
were
a
faroff
sept
of
the
macdonalds
of
clanranald
the
future
marshals
father
was
educated
at
the
scots
college
in
paris
and
was
for
some
time
a
tutor
in
clanranalds
household
owing
to
his
knowledge
of
french
he
was
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
helping
flora
macdonald
to
arrange
the
escape
of
prince
charles
he
accompanied
the
prince
to
france
and
obtained
a
commission
in
ogilvies
regiment
of
foot
in
1768
vall
macachaim
or
neil
macdonald
as
he
was
called
in
france
retired
on
a
pension
of
thirty
pounds
a
year
on
this
pittance
he
brought
up
his
family
at
sancerre
the
future
marshal
was
born
at
sedan
on
november
17
1765
he
was
educated
for
the
army
at
a
military
academy
in
paris
kept
by
a
scotchman
paulet
but
owing
to
bad
mathematics
he
was
unable
to
enter
the
artillery
and
engineering
school
this
failure
came
as
a
bitter
blow
to
the
keen
young
soldier
who
after
reading
homer
already
imagined
himself
an
achilles
but
in
1784
his
chance
came
the
dutch
threatened
by
the
emperor
joseph
ii
had
to
improvise
an
army
and
macdonald
accepted
a
pair
of
colours
in
a
regiment
raised
by
a
frenchman
the
count
de
maillebois
a
few
months
later
the
regiment
was
disbanded
as
the
dutch
bought
the
peace
they
could
not
gain
by
arms
the
young
officer
thus
thrown
on
his
own
resources
was
glad
to
accept
a
cadetship
in
dillons
irish
regiment
in
the
french
kings
service
and
at
the
moment
the
revolution
broke
out
he
was
a
sublieutenant
in
that
corps
owing
to
emigration
and
the
fortune
of
war
promotion
came
quickly
macdonald
also
was
lucky
in
having
a
friend
in
general
beurnonville
on
whose
staff
he
served
till
he
was
transferred
to
that
of
dumouriez
the
commanderinchief
as
a
reward
for
his
services
at
jemmappes
and
elsewhere
he
was
made
lieutenantcolonel
and
early
in
1793
his
friend
beurnonville
who
had
become
war
minister
gave
him
his
colonelcy
and
the
command
of
the
picardy
regiment
one
of
the
four
senior
corps
of
the
old
french
infantry
the
young
colonel
of
twentyeight
could
not
expect
to
be
always
so
favoured
by
fortune
dumouriezs
failure
at
neerwinden
and
subsequent
desertion
to
the
allies
cast
a
cloud
of
suspicion
on
his
protégé
at
a
moment
when
to
be
suspected
was
to
be
condemned
luckily
some
of
the
commissioners
from
the
convention
could
recognise
merit
but
macdonald
spent
many
anxious
months
amid
denunciations
and
accusations
from
those
who
grudged
him
his
colonelcy
to
his
intense
surprise
he
was
at
last
summoned
before
the
dread
commissioners
and
told
that
for
his
zeal
he
was
to
be
promoted
general
of
brigade
overcome
by
this
unexpected
turn
of
fortune
he
wished
to
refuse
the
honour
and
pleaded
his
youth
and
inexperience
and
was
promptly
given
the
choice
of
accepting
or
becoming
a
suspect
and
being
arrested
safe
for
the
moment
macdonald
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
his
new
duties
but
still
denunciations
and
accusations
were
hurled
against
him
fresh
commissioners
came
from
the
assembly
and
it
was
only
their
fortunate
recall
to
paris
that
saved
the
general
from
arrest
then
came
the
decree
banishing
all
cidevant
nobles
macdonald
fearing
after
this
order
that
if
he
met
with
the
slightest
check
he
would
be
greeted
with
cries
of
treachery
demanded
written
orders
from
the
new
commissioners
confirming
him
in
his
employment
these
were
refused
as
also
his
resignation
with
the
curt
reply
if
you
leave
the
army
we
will
have
you
arrested
and
brought
to
trial
in
this
dilemma
he
found
a
friend
in
the
representative
isore
who
struck
by
his
ability
and
industry
took
up
his
cause
and
from
that
moment
macdonald
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
revolutionary
tribunal

étienne
macdonald
duke
of
tarentum
from
a
lithograph
by
delpech

in
november
1794
he
was
quite
unexpectedly
gazetted
general
of
division
in
the
army
of
pichegru
and
took
part
in
the
winter
campaign
against
holland
where
he
proved
his
capacity
by
seizing
the
occasion
of
a
hard
frost
to
cross
the
vaal
on
the
ice
and
surprise
the
anglohanoverian
force
at
nimeguen
a
few
days
later
during
the
general
advance
he
captured
naarden
the
masterpiece
of
the
great
engineer
cohorn
proud
of
his
success
he
hastened
to
inform
the
commanderinchief
pichegru
and
was
greeted
by
a
laugh
and
bah
i
pay
no
attention
now
to
anything
less
than
the
surrender
of
provinces
the
blasé
commanderinchief
a
week
or
two
later
himself
performed
the
exploit
of
capturing
the
icebound
dutch
fleet
with
a
cavalry
brigade
and
a
battery
of
horse
artillery

after
serving
on
the
rhine
in
1796
macdonald
was
transferred
in
1798
to
the
army
of
italy
and
sent
to
rome
to
relieve
gouvion
st
cyr
when
war
broke
out
between
france
and
naples
the
troops
in
southern
italy
were
formed
into
the
army
of
naples
under
championnet
the
commanderinchief
overrated
the
fighting
qualities
of
the
neapolitan
troops
and
thought
it
prudent
to
evacuate
rome
macdonald
was
entrusted
with
this
duty
and
was
further
required
to
cover
the
concentration
of
championnets
army
the
hardheaded
scotchman
had
however
gauged
to
a
nicety
the
morale
of
the
neapolitan
army
and
although
he
had
but
five
thousand
troops
against
forty
thousand
neapolitans
under
the
celebrated
austrian
general
mack
he
engaged
the
enemy
at
cività
castellana
defeated
them
followed
them
up
drove
them
out
of
rome
and
over
the
frontier
and
practically
annihilated
the
whole
force
unfortunately
he
wrote
a
comical
account
of
the
operations
to
his
chief
who
having
no
sense
of
humour
felt
that
his
evacuation
of
rome
had
to
say
the
least
of
it
been
hurried
and
undignified
championnet
therefore
greeted
his
victorious
lieutenant
with
the
words
you
want
to
make
me
pass
for
a
damned
fool
and
no
explanations
could
appease
his
rage
so
bitter
became
the
quarrel
that
macdonald
had
to
resign
his
command

by
february
1799
championnet
had
fallen
into
disgrace
with
the
directory
and
macdonald
was
gazetted
in
his
place
commanderinchief
when
he
arrived
in
naples
and
took
up
his
command
the
situation
seemed
quiet
but
the
farseeing
soldier
read
the
signs
of
the
times
the
élite
of
the
french
army
was
locked
up
in
egypt
austria
and
russia
were
bent
on
extinguishing
france
and
her
revolutionary
ideas
accordingly
the
general
at
once
set
about
quietly
concentrating
his
troops
to
meet
an
invasion
of
northern
italy
by
the
allies
with
his
keen
military
insight
he
desired
to
evacuate
all
southern
italy
retaining
only
such
fortresses
as
could
be
well
supplied
but
the
principle
of
keeping
everything
gained
the
day
still
on
the
news
of
schérers
defeat
at
magnano
by
the
impetuous
suvaroff
the
army
of
naples
was
ready
at
once
to
start
for
the
north
and
set
off
to
try
and
pick
up
communication
with
general
moreau
who
was
reforming
the
army
of
italy
at
genoa
the
idea
was
that
a
concentrated
movement
should
be
made
against
the
allies
through
the
apennines
unfortunately
there
existed
a
bitter
rivalry
between
the
army
of
italy
and
the
army
of
naples
consequently
on
june
17th
macdonald
found
himself
with
twentyfive
thousand
men
near
piacenza
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
with
no
support
save
two
divisions
of
the
army
of
italy
which
had
come
in
from
bologna
and
whose
commanders
were
jealous
of
his
orders
still
there
was
always
the
hope
that
moreau
might
after
all
be
coming
to
his
assistance
and
accordingly
he
determined
to
stand
and
fight
in
the
action
of
june
17th
owing
to
the
lack
of
cooperation
from
one
of
the
attached
divisions
the
general
was
ridden
over
by
a
division
of
the
enemys
cavalry
carried
about
in
a
litter
he
directed
all
movements
during
the
18th
and
held
the
enemy
at
bay
along
the
mountain
torrent
of
the
trebbia
on
the
19th
he
determined
to
take
the
initiative
but
owing
to
the
collapse
of
the
attached
division
which
formed
his
centre
he
had
to
fall
back
on
his
old
position
which
he
held
throughout
the
whole
day
during
the
three
days
fighting
on
the
trebbia
the
french
had
lost
a
third
of
their
men
and
nearly
all
their
officers
still
early
on
the
morning
of
the
20th
the
retreat
was
effected
in
good
order
save
that
one
of
the
attached
divisions
under
victor
started
so
late
that
it
was
overtaken
by
the
enemy
and
abandoned
all
its
guns
but
macdonald
at
once
returned
to
its
aid
and
saved
the
artillery
for
as
he
sarcastically
wrote
to
victor
he
found
neither
friends
nor
foes
both
sides
had
run
away

the
battle
of
the
trebbia
brought
into
notice
the
sterling
qualities
of
the
french
commander
and
when
he
was
recalled
to
paris
he
found
that
military
opinion
was
on
his
side
and
that
bonaparte
himself
highly
approved
of
his
conduct
thenceforward
the
opinion
of
my
amphitryon
was
settled
in
my
favour
macdonalds
next
employment
was
in
command
of
the
army
of
the
grisons
whose
duty
was
to
cover
moreaus
right
rear
in
his
advance
down
the
danube
and
to
keep
up
communication
with
the
army
of
italy
in
the
valley
of
the
po
it
was
in
the
performance
of
this
duty
that
the
army
of
the
grisons
crossed
the
splügen
pass
in
winter
in
spite
of
glaciers
and
avalanches
a
feat
immeasurably
superior
to
bonapartes
task
in
crossing
the
much
easier
great
st
bernard
pass
after
the
snows
had
melted
unfortunately
for
macdonald
bonaparte
believed
him
to
belong
to
moreaus
faction
after
hohenlinden
the
future
emperor
who
was
afraid
that
moreaus
glory
would
outshine
his
own
placed
all
that
generals
friends
on
the
black
book
further
owing
to
his
outspokenness
talleyrand
had
conceived
a
hatred
of
the
hero
of
the
splügen
accordingly
he
found
himself
in
deep
disgrace
first
he
was
exiled
as
ambassador
at
copenhagen
then
his
enemies
tried
to
get
him
sent
to
russia
in
the
same
capacity
but
he
refused
to
go
and
for
the
next
few
years
lived
the
life
of
a
quiet
country
gentleman
on
his
estate
of
courcelles
le
roi
like
most
of
the
generals
macdonald
was
by
now
comparatively
well
off
for
the
french
government
on
the
conquest
of
a
country
had
allowed
its
generals
to
take
what
works
of
art
they
chose
after
the
commissioners
had
selected
the
best
for
the
national
collection
at
the
louvre
the
generals
share
as
commanderinchief
at
naples
had
been
valued
by
experts
at
thirtyfour
thousand
pounds
unfortunately
however
this
booty
and
many
masterpieces
which
he
had
bought
himself
were
all
lost
in
the
hurried
march
north
that
ended
in
the
battle
of
the
trebbia

it
was
not
till
1809
that
macdonald
was
summoned
from
his
retreat
in
that
year
the
emperor
needed
every
soldier
of
ability
with
the
spanish
ulcer
eating
at
his
vitals
and
the
war
with
austria
on
his
hands
accordingly
at
a
days
notice
he
was
ordered
to
hurry
off
to
italy
to
help
napoleons
stepson
prince
eugène
who
was
opposed
by
an
austrian
army
under
the
archduke
john

on
arriving
in
italy
the
old
soldier
found
that
prince
eugène
unaccustomed
to
an
independent
command
had
opened
the
gate
of
italy
to
the
austrians
by
his
impetuous
action
at
sacile
the
french
troops
were
in
complete
disorganisation
and
the
slightest
activity
on
the
part
of
the
austrians
would
have
turned
the
retreat
into
a
rout
prince
eugène
who
was
without
a
spark
of
jealousy
and
in
reality
a
man
of
considerable
character
greeted
his
mentor
with
delight
macdonald
at
once
pointed
out
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
retire
as
far
as
mantua
because
the
archduke
would
not
venture
to
penetrate
far
into
italy
until
a
decision
had
been
arrived
at
between
the
main
armies
on
the
danube
under
his
careful
supervision
order
and
discipline
were
restored
among
the
french
troops
on
the
line
of
the
adige
the
news
of
the
french
success
at
eckmühl
and
ratisbon
automatically
cleared
the
austrians
out
of
northern
italy
during
the
pursuit
the
general
had
to
impose
on
himself
the
severest
selfcontrol
because
though
prince
eugène
invariably
accepted
his
advice
the
disaster
at
sacile
had
for
the
time
broken
his
nerve
and
again
and
again
he
spoiled
his
mentors
best
combinations
by
ordering
a
halt
whenever
the
enemy
appeared
to
be
going
to
offer
any
resistance
it
was
hard
indeed
to
accept
subsequent
apologies
with
a
courteous
smile
when
it
was
success
alone
that
would
win
back
the
emperors
favour
but
at
last
patience
had
its
reward
while
the
viceroy
himself
pursued
the
main
force
of
the
enemy
he
detached
his
lieutenant
with
a
strong
corps
to
take
trieste
and
to
pick
up
communication
with
marmont
who
was
bringing
up
the
army
of
dalmatia
macdonald
was
given
carte
blanche
trieste
and
görz
were
taken
the
junction
with
marmont
was
speedily
effected
and
the
combined
forces
hurried
on
towards
vienna
the
great
entrenched
camp
at
laybach
blocked
the
way
macdonald
had
not
the
necessary
heavy
artillery
with
which
to
capture
it
he
determined
therefore
to
make
a
threatening
demonstration
by
day
and
slip
past
it
by
night
but
at
ten
oclock
in
the
evening
a
flag
of
truce
arrived
offering
a
capitulation
you
are
doing
wisely
said
the
imperturbable
scotchman
i
was
just
going
to
sound
the
attack

at
gratz
he
overtook
prince
eugènes
army
at
the
moment
that
the
ill
news
of
the
battle
of
aspernessling
arrived
then
came
the
summons
to
hurry
to
the
assistance
of
the
emperor
after
marching
sixty
leagues
in
three
days
the
army
of
italy
arrived
at
nine
oclock
at
night
on
july
4th
at
the
imperial
headquarters
at
ebersdorf
during
that
night
it
crossed
the
danube
under
cover
of
the
terrific
thunderstorm
which
hid
the
french
advance
from
the
austrians
on
the
afternoon
of
july
5th
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
macdonald
to
attempt
to
seize
the
plateau
which
formed
the
austrian
centre
as
the
general
well
knew
the
emperor
had
been
mistaken
in
thinking
that
the
enemy
were
evacuating
their
position
still
he
had
to
obey
orders
and
night
alone
saved
his
cruelly
shaken
battalions
next
day
was
fought
the
terrible
battle
of
wagram
at
the
critical
moment
of
the
fight
when
the
emperor
heard
that
masséna
on
his
left
wing
was
being
driven
in
on
the
bridgehead
amid
the
confusion
and
rout
he
ordered
macdonald
to
attempt
by
a
bold
counterstroke
to
break
the
enemys
centre
the
austrians
were
advancing
in
masses
with
nothing
in
front
of
them
and
the
bridge
the
only
line
of
retreat
was
threatened
to
meet
this
situation
macdonald
deployed
four
battalions
in
line
at
the
double
behind
them
he
formed
up
the
rest
of
his
corps
in
two
solid
columns
and
closed
the
rear
of
this
immense
rectangle
of
troops
by
nansoutys
cavalry
covered
by
the
fire
of
a
massed
battery
of
a
hundred
guns
he
discharged
this
huge
body
of
thirty
thousand
troops
against
the
austrians
and
in
spite
of
vast
losses
from
the
enemys
artillery
by
sheer
weight
of
human
beings
he
completely
checked
the
austrian
advance
and
broke
their
centre
if
the
cavalry
of
the
guard
had
only
charged
home
the
enemy
would
have
been
driven
off
the
field
in
complete
rout
still
unsupported
the
column
continued
its
victorious
career
taking
six
thousand
prisoners
and
ten
guns
the
only
trophies
of
the
day
next
morning
the
hero
of
wagram
lame
from
the
effect
of
a
kick
from
his
horse
was
summoned
before
the
emperor

napoleon
embraced
him
with
the
words
let
us
be
friends
till
death
replied
his
staunch
lieutenant
then
came
his
reward
you
have
behaved
valiantly
continued
the
emperor
and
have
rendered
me
the
greatest
services
as
indeed
throughout
the
entire
campaign
on
the
battlefield
of
your
glory
where
i
owe
you
so
large
a
share
of
yesterdays
success
i
make
you
a
marshal
of
france
you
have
long
deserved
it

after
the
ratification
of
peace
the
emperor
created
his
new
marshal
duke
of
tarentum
granted
him
a
present
of
sixty
thousand
francs
and
presented
him
with
the
grand
cordon
of
the
legion
of
honour
having
at
last
regained
the
emperors
favour
the
marshal
had
never
again
to
complain
of
lack
of
employment
from
wagram
he
was
sent
to
watch
the
army
of
the
archduke
john
thereafter
he
was
appointed
commanderinchief
of
the
army
of
italy
in
1810
he
was
despatched
to
spain
to
take
command
in
catalonia
like
his
fellow
marshals
macdonald
hated
the
spanish
war
which
was
a
war
of
posts
and
devoid
of
glory
but
he
showed
his
versatility
by
capturing
without
artillery
the
stronghold
of
figueras

it
was
while
suffering
from
a
bad
attack
of
gout
after
this
success
that
he
was
summoned
from
spain
to
tilsit
to
command
the
corps
comprised
of
prussian
troops
which
was
to
join
the
grand
army
in
its
advance
into
russia
as
he
graphically
put
it
i
had
left
my
armchair
in
the
fortress
of
figueras
i
left
one
crutch
in
paris
and
the
other
in
berlin
the
duke
of
tarentums
duty
was
to
guard
the
têtedupont
at
dunaberg
near
the
mouth
of
the
dwina
consequently
he
was
spared
a
great
many
of
the
horrors
of
the
terrible
retreat
still
he
had
his
full
share
of
troubles
for
the
prussians
deserted
him
and
went
over
to
the
enemy
so
confident
was
he
of
the
loyalty
of
his
subordinates
that
this
desertion
took
him
quite
unawares
and
in
spite
of
warnings
he
waited
for
the
divisions
to
rejoin
him
declaring
that
my
life
my
career
shall
never
be
stained
with
the
reproach
that
i
have
committed
the
cowardly
action
of
deserting
troops
committed
to
my
care
fortunately
his
eyes
were
opened
by
letters
which
he
intercepted
with
a
handful
of
troops
he
escaped
to
dantzig
on
returning
to
paris
macdonald
was
greeted
with
a
cold
reception
by
the
emperor
who
thought
that
the
desertion
of
the
prussians
was
due
to
his
negligence
but
the
marshals
character
was
soon
cleared
and
a
reconciliation
followed
in
the
campaign
of
1813
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
duke
of
tarentum
to
watch
the
prussian
army
under
blücher
in
silesia
while
the
emperor
operated
against
the
austrians
round
dresden
whilst
thus
employed
he
was
defeated
on
august
26th
at
the
katzbach
the
prussians
had
established
themselves
on
the
heights
at
jauer
macdonald
attempted
by
a
combined
frontal
attack
and
a
turning
movement
to
dislodge
them
unfortunately
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
the
french
artillery
became
embedded
in
the
mud
the
infantry
could
not
fire
the
cavalry
could
not
charge
and
a
hurried
retreat
alone
saved
the
army
from
absolute
annihilation
for
as
macdonald
wrote
in
his
despatch
the
generals
cannot
prevent
the
men
from
seeking
shelter
as
their
muskets
are
useless
to
them

the
repulse
at
the
katzbach
did
not
weaken
the
emperors
esteem
for
the
marshal
and
a
few
days
later
he
sent
to
inquire
his
views
of
the
general
situation
with
absolute
courage
he
told
the
truth
the
situation
was
hopeless
the
only
wise
course
was
to
evacuate
all
garrisons
in
germany
and
retire
on
the
saale
unfortunately
such
a
retirement
would
have
meant
the
loss
of
napoleons
throne

on
the
third
day
of
the
battle
of
leipzig
in
the
midst
of
the
action
macdonald
was
deserted
by
all
the
hessian
troops
under
his
command
and
at
the
same
time
marshal
augereau
who
was
supposed
to
cover
his
right
withdrew
from
the
combat
accordingly
the
marshal
retired
with
the
remnants
of
his
corps
to
the
elster
only
to
find
the
bridge
blown
up
dragged
along
by
the
crowd
of
fugitives
he
determined
not
to
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
but
either
to
drown
or
shoot
himself
more
fortunate
however
than
prince
poniatowski
he
managed
to
cross
the
river
on
his
horse
once
safely
across
he
was
greeted
by
cries
from
the
other
bank
monsieur
le
maréchal
save
your
soldiers
save
your
children
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
no
advice
could
he
give
them
save
to
surrender

the
duke
of
tarentum
was
mainly
instrumental
in
saving
the
remnants
of
the
army
which
had
managed
to
cross
the
elster
going
straight
to
the
emperor
he
laid
the
situation
before
him
ruthlessly
tore
aside
the
tissue
of
lies
with
which
the
staff
were
trying
to
cajole
him
and
by
his
force
of
will
compelled
napoleon
who
for
the
time
was
quite
unnerved
and
mazed
to
hurry
on
the
retreat
to
the
rhine
it
was
entirely
owing
to
the
marshal
that
the
bavarians
were
brushed
aside
at
hanau
and
that
some
few
remnants
of
the
great
army
regained
france

in
the
famous
campaign
of
1814
macdonald
fought
fiercely
to
drive
the
enemy
out
of
france
his
corps
was
one
of
those
which
the
emperor
summoned
to
arcis
sur
aube
there
again
he
had
to
tell
napoleon
the
truth
and
convince
him
that
the
enemy
were
not
retreating
but
were
in
full
advance
on
paris
when
the
emperor
tried
to
retrieve
his
mistake
by
following
in
the
rear
the
marshal
was
in
favour
of
the
bolder
course
of
advancing
into
alsace
and
lorraine
and
of
raising
the
nation
in
arms
and
thus
starving
out
the
allies
by
cutting
off
their
supplies
and
reinforcements
and
no
doubt
he
was
right
for
the
czar
himself
said
that
the
allies
lost
more
than
three
thousand
troops
in
the
vosges
without
seeing
a
single
french
soldier

when
napoleon
reached
fontainebleau
he
found
that
he
had
shot
his
bolt
so
tired
were
his
officers
and
men
of
continual
fighting
that
when
ordered
to
charge
a
general
officer
in
front
of
his
men
had
called
out
damn
it
let
us
have
peace
consequently
when
macdonald
and
the
other
marshals
and
generals
were
informed
that
the
allies
would
no
longer
treat
with
napoleon
they
determined
to
make
him
abdicate
the
emperor
on
summoning
his
council
found
that
they
no
longer
feared
him
and
refused
to
listen
to
his
arguments
hoping
to
save
the
throne
for
his
son
he
despatched
caulaincourt
ney
marmont
and
macdonald
to
the
czar
offering
to
abdicate
the
best
terms
the
commissioners
could
get
from
the
czar
were
that
napoleon
must
give
up
all
hope
of
seeing
his
son
succeed
him
but
that
he
should
retain
his
imperial
title
and
should
be
allowed
to
rule
the
island
of
elba
the
czar
magnanimously
added
if
he
will
not
accept
this
sovereignty
and
if
he
can
find
no
shelter
elsewhere
tell
him
i
say
to
come
to
my
dominions
there
he
shall
be
received
as
a
sovereign
he
can
trust
the
word
of
alexander

ney
and
marmont
did
not
accompany
the
other
commissioners
with
their
sorrowful
terms
like
rats
they
left
the
sinking
ship
but
macdonald
was
of
a
strain
which
had
stood
the
test
of
the
45
and
his
proud
scotch
blood
boiled
up
when
the
insidious
talleyrand
suggested
that
he
should
desert
his
master
telling
him
that
he
had
now
fulfilled
all
his
engagements
and
was
free
no
i
am
not
was
the
stern
reply
and
nobody
knows
better
than
you
that
as
long
as
a
treaty
has
not
been
ratified
it
may
be
annulled
after
that
formality
is
ended
i
shall
know
what
to
do
the
stricken
emperor
met
his
two
faithful
commissioners
his
face
haggard
his
complexion
yellow
and
sickly
but
for
once
at
least
he
felt
gratitude
i
have
loaded
with
favours
he
said
many
others
who
have
now
deserted
and
abandoned
me
you
who
owe
me
nothing
have
remained
faithful
i
appreciate
your
loyalty
too
late
and
i
sincerely
regret
that
i
am
now
in
a
position
in
which
i
can
only
prove
my
gratitude
by
words

after
napoleon
started
for
elba
macdonald
never
saw
him
again
like
all
his
fellow
marshals
except
davout
he
swore
allegiance
to
louis
xviii
looking
on
him
as
the
only
hope
of
france
but
unlike
the
most
of
them
he
served
him
loyally
though
as
he
truly
said
the
government
behaved
like
a
sick
man
who
is
utterly
indifferent
to
all
around
him
as
a
soldier
and
a
liberal
he
could
not
disguise
his
repugnance
for
many
of
its
measures
as
secretary
to
the
chamber
of
peers
he
fought
tooth
and
nail
against
the
governments
first
measure
a
bill
attempting
to
restrict
the
liberties
of
the
peers
the
king
summoned
the
marshal
and
rebuked
him
for
both
speaking
and
voting
against
the
government
adding
when
i
take
the
trouble
to
draw
up
a
bill
i
have
good
reasons
for
wishing
it
to
pass
but
the
old
soldier
who
had
never
feared
to
speak
the
truth
to
napoleon
himself
was
not
to
be
overawed
by
the
attempted
sternness
of
the
feeble
bourbon
he
pointed
out
that
if
all
bills
presented
by
the
king
were
bound
to
pass
registration
would
serve
equally
well
since
to
you
belongs
the
initiative
adding
with
quiet
sarcasm
and
we
must
remain
as
mute
as
the
late
corps
legislatif
the
chancellor
stopped
him
as
he
left
the
kings
presence
telling
him
he
should
show
more
reserve
and
pick
his
words
sir
chancellor
said
the
marshal
i
have
never
learned
to
twist
myself
and
i
pity
the
king
if
what
he
ought
to
know
is
concealed
from
him
for
my
part
i
shall
always
speak
to
him
honestly
and
serve
him
in
the
same
manner

when
neglect
of
the
army
the
partiality
shown
to
favourites
and
the
general
spirit
of
discontent
throughout
france
tempted
napoleon
once
again
to
seize
the
reins
of
government
macdonald
was
commanding
the
twentyfirst
military
division
at
bourges
as
he
says
the
news
of
the
emperors
return
took
away
my
breath
and
i
at
once
foresaw
the
misfortunes
that
have
since
settled
upon
france
placing
his
duty
to
his
country
and
his
plighted
faith
before
the
longings
of
his
heart
he
remained
faithful
to
the
bourbons
it
was
the
marshal
who
at
lyons
vainly
endeavoured
to
aid
the
count
of
artois
to
organise
resistance
to
napoleons
advance
it
was
he
who
showed
the
king
the
vanity
of
neys
boast
that
he
would
bring
back
the
emperor
in
an
iron
cage
who
impressed
on
him
napoleons
activity
and
who
persuaded
him
to
retire
northwards
to
lille
and
there
attempt
to
rally
his
friends
to
his
aid
ministers
and
king
were
only
too
thankful
to
leave
all
arrangements
to
this
cautious
indefatigable
soldier
who
supervised
everything
through
every
town
the
monarch
passed
he
found
the
same
feeling
of
apathy
the
same
tendency
among
the
troops
to
cry
vive
lempereur
the
same
lack
of
enterprise
among
the
officials
typical
of
the
situation
was
the
subprefect
of
bethune
who
stood
at
the
door
of
the
royal
carriage
one
leg
halfnaked
his
feet
in
slippers
his
coat
under
his
arm
his
waistcoat
unbuttoned
his
hat
on
his
head
one
hand
struggling
with
his
sword
the
other
trying
to
fasten
his
necktie
the
marshal
ever
mindful
of
napoleons
activity
had
to
hurry
the
poor
king
and
louis
portmanteau
with
his
six
clean
shirts
and
his
old
pair
of
slippers
got
lost
on
the
road
this
loss
more
than
anything
else
brought
home
to
the
monarch
his
pitiable
condition
they
have
taken
my
shirts
said
he
to
macdonald
i
had
not
too
many
in
the
first
place
but
what
i
regret
still
more
is
the
loss
of
my
slippers
some
day
my
dear
marshal
you
will
appreciate
the
value
of
slippers
that
have
taken
the
shape
of
your
feet
with
napoleon
at
paris
lille
seemed
to
offer
but
little
security
and
accordingly
the
king
determined
to
seek
safety
in
belgium
the
marshal
escorted
him
to
the
frontier
and
saw
him
put
in
charge
of
the
belgian
troops
then
promising
to
be
faithful
to
his
oath
he
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
old
monarch
with
the
words
farewell
sir
au
revoir
in
three
months

macdonald
returned
to
paris
and
lived
quietly
in
his
own
house
refusing
to
have
any
intercourse
with
napoleon
or
his
ministers
within
three
months
came
the
news
of
waterloo
thereafter
against
his
will
but
in
accordance
with
orders
he
joined
fouché
who
had
established
a
provisional
government
fouché
who
knew
the
importance
of
outward
signs
sent
him
off
to
try
and
persuade
the
returning
monarch
to
win
over
the
army
by
mounting
the
tricolour
instead
of
the
white
cockade
but
the
king
was
obstinate
the
marshal
quoted
henry
ivs
famous
saying
paris
is
worth
a
mass
the
king
countered
with
yes
but
it
was
not
a
very
catholic
one
but
though
the
king
would
not
listen
to
his
advice
he
called
on
him
to
show
his
devotion
the
imperial
army
had
to
be
disbandeda
most
unpopular
and
thankless
task
requiring
both
tact
and
firmness
at
his
sovereigns
earnest
request
macdonald
undertook
the
duty
but
with
two
stipulations
first
that
he
should
have
complete
freedom
of
action
secondly
that
he
should
be
in
no
way
an
instrument
for
inflicting
punishment
on
individuals
immediately
on
taking
up
his
appointment
at
bourges
the
marshal
summoned
all
the
generals
and
officers
to
his
presence
and
informed
them
that
under
fouchés
supervision
a
list
of
proscribed
had
been
drawn
up
his
advice
was
that
all
on
this
list
should
fly
at
once
that
same
evening
police
officials
arrived
in
the
camp
to
arrest
the
proscribed
playing
on
the
fears
of
the
mouchards
he
locked
them
up
all
night
alleging
that
it
was
to
save
them
from
the
infuriated
soldiery
thus
all
the
proscribed
escaped
but
neither
fouché
nor
the
duc
de
berri
cared
to
bring
the
old
soldier
to
task
for
this
action
so
the
marshal
was
left
to
work
in
his
own
way
and
by
october
21
1815
thanks
to
his
firmness
and
tact
the
bold
and
unhappy
army
which
had
for
so
long
been
triumphant
was
quietly
dissolved
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
challenging
the
royal
decision

the
marshal
did
not
mix
much
in
politics
the
king
at
the
second
restoration
created
him
archchancellor
of
the
legion
of
honour
this
post
gave
him
considerable
occupation
as
it
entailed
the
supervision
of
the
schools
for
the
children
of
those
who
had
received
the
cross
and
he
was
for
long
happily
employed
in
looking
after
the
welfare
of
the
descendants
of
his
late
comradesinarms
in
november
1830
the
plea
of
the
gout
came
opportunely
at
the
moment
of
the
commencement
of
the
july
monarchy
and
the
marshal
resigned
the
archchancellorship
and
returned
to
his
estate
of
courcelles
where
he
lived
in
retirement
till
his
death
on
september
25
1840
at
the
age
of
seventyfive

it
was
a
maxim
of
napoleon
that
success
covers
everything
that
it
is
only
failure
which
cannot
be
forgiven
against
the
duke
of
tarentums
name
stood
the
defeats
of
trebbia
and
the
katzbach
but
in
spite
of
this
napoleon
never
treated
him
as
he
treated
dupont
and
the
other
unfortunate
generals
for
macdonald
possessed
qualities
which
were
too
important
to
be
overlooked
with
all
the
fiery
enthusiasm
of
the
gael
he
possessed
to
an
unusual
degree
the
caution
of
the
lowland
scot
possessed
of
great
reasoning
powers
and
of
the
gift
of
seeing
clearly
both
sides
of
a
question
he
had
the
necessary
force
of
character
to
make
up
his
mind
which
course
to
pursue
and
to
persevere
in
it
to
the
logical
issue
in
the
crossing
of
the
vaal
in
the
fighting
round
rome
in
the
campaign
with
prince
eugène
in
italy
before
and
after
leipzig
and
in
his
final
campaign
in
france
he
proved
the
correctness
of
his
judgment
and
his
capacity
to
work
out
his
carefully
prepared
combinations
his
defeat
at
the
trebbia
was
due
to
the
treachery
of
the
general
commanding
one
of
the
attached
divisions
the
rout
at
the
katzbach
was
primarily
due
to
climatic
conditions
and
to
the
want
of
cohesion
among
the
recently
drafted
recruits
which
formed
the
bulk
of
his
army
on
the
stricken
field
of
wagram
and
in
the
running
fight
at
hanau
his
inflexible
will
and
the
quickness
with
which
he
grasped
the
vital
points
of
the
problem
saved
the
emperor
and
his
army

the
only
black
spot
in
his
otherwise
glorious
career
is
the
battle
of
leipzig
long
must
the
cry
of
monsieur
le
maréchal
save
your
soldiers
save
your
children
have
rung
in
his
ear
for
once
he
had
forgotten
his
proud
boast
that
he
never
deserted
troops
entrusted
to
his
command
like
the
emperor
and
his
fellow
marshals
and
most
of
the
generals
for
the
moment
he
lost
his
nerve
but
he
could
still
though
humbly
boast
that
he
was
the
first
to
remember
his
duties
and
to
try
and
save
the
remnant
of
the
troops
who
had
crossed
the
elster

duty
and
truth
were
his
watchwords
once
only
he
failed
in
his
duty
never
did
he
shirk
telling
the
truth
it
was
this
fearless
utterance
of
the
truth
more
than
any
connection
with
moreau
which
was
the
cause
of
his
long
years
of
disgrace
it
was
this
fearlessness
strange
to
say
which
in
the
end
conquered
the
emperor
and
which
so
charmed
king
louis
that
he
nicknamed
him
his
outspokenness

duke
of
ragusa


auguste
frédéric
louis
viesse
de
marmont
the
youngest
of
napoleons
marshals
was
born
at
châtillonsurseine
on
july
25
1774
the
family
of
viesse
belonged
to
the
smaller
nobility
who
from
the
days
of
richelieu
had
supplied
the
officers
of
the
line
for
the
old
royal
army
marmonts
father
had
destined
him
from
the
cradle
for
the
military
career
and
had
devoted
his
life
to
training
him
both
in
body
and
mind
for
the
profession
of
arms
his
hours
of
patience
and
selfdenial
were
not
thrown
away
for
thanks
to
his
early
spartan
training
the
duke
of
ragusa
seldom
knew
fatigue
or
sickness
and
owing
to
this
physical
strength
was
able
without
neglecting
his
professional
duties
to
spend
hours
on
scientific
and
literary
work
in
1792
young
marmont
at
the
age
of
eighteen
passed
the
entrance
examination
for
the
artillery
school
at
châlons
and
started
his
military
career
with
his
fathers
oftrepeated
words
ringing
in
his
ears
merit
without

is
infinitely
better
than
success
without
merit
but
determination
and
merit
always
command
success
the
young
artillery
cadet
had
both
determination
and
capacity
and
his
early
career
foreshadowed
his
future
success
aristocratic
to
the
bone
marmont
detested
the
excesses
of
the
revolution
but
politics
during
his
early
years
had
little
effect
on
his
thoughts
which
were
solely
fixed
on
military
glory
the
exigencies
of
the
revolutionary
wars
cut
short
his
student
days
at
châlons
and
before
the
end
of
1792
he
was
gazetted
to
the
first
artillery
regiment
in
february
1793
he
saw
his
first
active
service
with
the
army
of
the
alps
under
general
kellermann
owing
to
the
dearth
of
trained
officers
though
only
newly
gazetted
he
performed
all
the
duties
of
a
senior
colonel
laying
out
entrenched
camps
and
commanding
the
artillery
of
the
division
to
which
he
was
attached
it
was
with
this
promising
record
already
behind
him
that
he
attracted
bonapartes
attention
at
the
siege
of
toulon
by
his
admirable
handling
of
the
guns
under
his
command
and
by
his
inventive
powers
which
overcame
all
obstacles
from
that
day
the
corsican
destined
him
for
his
service
and
during
the
campaign
in
the
maritime
alps
used
him
as
an
unofficial
aidedecamp
so
devoted
did
marmont
become
to
the
future
emperor
that
when
bonaparte
was
arrested
at
the
time
of
robespierres
fall
he
and
junot
formed
a
plan
of
rescuing
their
idol
by
killing
the
sentries
and
carrying
him
off
by
sea

when
bonaparte
returned
to
paris
marmont
accompanied
him
and
was
offered
the
post
of
superintendent
of
the
gun
factory
at
moulins
he
contemptuously
refused
this
position
telling
the
inspector
of
ordnance
that
he
would
not
mind
such
a
post
in
peace
time
but
that
he
was
going
to
see
as
much
active
service
as
he
could
while
the
war
lasted
so
at
his
own
request
he
was
posted
to
the
army
of
pichegru
which
was
besieging
maintz

a
temporary
suspension
of
hostilities
on
the
rhine
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
once
again
joining
his
chosen
leader
and
early
in
1796
he
started
for
italy
on
bonapartes
staff
lodi
was
one
of
the
great
days
of
his
life
early
in
the
action
he
captured
one
of
the
enemys
batteries
but
a
moment
later
he
was
thrown
from
his
horse
and
ridden
over
by
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
without
however
receiving
a
single
scratch
scarcely
had
he
mounted
when
he
was
despatched
along
the
river
under
fire
of
the
whole
austrian
force
on
the
other
bank
to
carry
orders
to
the
commander
of
the
cavalry
who
was
engaged
in
fording
the
river
higher
up
of
his
escort
of
five
two
were
killed
while
his
horse
was
severely
wounded
yet
he
managed
to
return
in
time
to
take
his
place
among
the
band
of
heroes
who
forced
the
long
bridge
in
the
face
of
a
storm
of
bullets
and
grape
castiglione
added
to
his
laurels
for
it
was
his
handling
of
the
artillery
that
enabled
augereau
to
win
his
great
victory
the
marshal
in
his
memoirs
asserts
that
this
short
campaign
was
the
severest
strain
he
ever
underwent
i
never
at
any
other
time
endured
such
fatigue
as
during
the
eight
days
of
that
campaign
always
on
horseback
on
reconnaissance
or
fighting
i
was
i
believe
five
days
without
sleep
save
for
a
few
stolen
minutes
after
the
final
battle
the
generalinchief
gave
me
leave
to
rest
and
i
took
full
advantage
of
it
i
ate
i
lay
down
and
i
slept
twentyfour
hours
at
a
stretch
and
thanks
to
youth
hardiness
a
good
constitution
and
the
restorative
powers
of
sleep
i
was
as
fresh
again
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign

though
castiglione
thus
brought
him
fresh
honours
it
nearly
caused
an
estrangement
between
him
and
his
chief
for
bonaparte
ever
with
an
eye
to
the
future
desiring
to
gain
as
many
friends
as
possible
chose
one
of
berthiers
staff
officers
to
take
the
news
of
the
victory
to
paris
this
was
a
bitter
blow
to
his
ambitious
aidedecamp
whose
pride
was
further
piqued
because
his
hero
forgetting
that
he
had
not
to
deal
with
one
of
the
ordinary
adventurers
who
formed
so
large
a
number
of
the
officers
of
the
army
of
italy
with
great
want
of
tact
had
offered
him
opportunities
of
adding
to
his
wealth
by
perquisites
and
commissions
abhorrent
to
the
eyes
of
a
descendant
of
an
honourable
family
but
the
exigencies
of
war
and
the
thirst
for
glory
left
little
time
for
brooding
and
bonaparte
recognising
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
took
the
opportunity
of
the
successful
fighting
which
penned
würmser
into
mantua
to
send
marmont
with
despatches
to
paris
as
his
reward
the
minister
of
war
promoted
him
colonel
and
commandant
of
the
second
regiment
of
horse
artillery
a
curious
state
of
affairs
arose
from
this
appointment
for
promotion
in
the
artillery
ran
quite
independent
of
ordinary
army
rank
accordingly
the
army

ran

marmont
hurried
back
to
italy
in
time
to
join
bonapartes
staff
an
hour
before
the
battle
of
arcola
the
austrians
were
making
their
last
effort
to
relieve
the
fortress
of
mantua
and
it
seemed
as
if
they
would
be
successful
as
alvinzi
had
concentrated
forty
thousand
troops
against
twentysix
thousand
the
french
attempted
a
surprise
but
were
discovered
and
for
three
days
the
fate
of
the
campaign
hung
on
the
stubborn
fight
in
the
marshes
of
arcola
it
was
marmont
who
helped
to
extricate
bonaparte
when
he
was
flung
off
the
embankment
into
the
ditch
a
service
which
bonaparte
never
forgot
diplomatic
missions
to
venice
and
the
vatican
slightly
turned
the
young
soldiers
head
and
his
chief
had
soon
to
give
him
a
severe
reprimand
for
loitering
among
josephines
beauties
at
milan
instead
of
hastening
back
to
headquarters
but
to
a
man
of
marmonts
character
one
word
of
warning
was
enough
his
head
governed
his
heart
glory
was
his
loadstar
ambitious
though
he
was
he
was
essentially
a
man
of
honour
and
fine
feelings
and
refused
the
hand
of
pauline
bonaparte
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
did
not
truly
love
her

a
year
later
he
made
a
love
match
with
mademoiselle
perrégaux
but
differences
of
temperament
and
the
long
separation
which
his
military
career
imposed
caused
the
marriage
to
turn
out
unhappily
and
this
lack
of
domestic
felicity
spoiled
the
marshals
life
and
nearly
embittered
his
whole
character
turning
him
for
the
time
into
a
selfcentred
man
with
an
eye
solely
to
his
own
glory
and
a
sharp
tongue
which
did
not
spare
even
his
own
friends
yet
in
his
early
days
marmont
was
a
bright
and
cheerful
companion
and
no
one
enjoyed
more
a
practical
joke
getting
up
sham
duels
between
cowards
or
sending
bogus
instructions
to
officious
commanders
but
fond
as
he
was
of
amusement
even
during
his
early
career
he
could
find
delight
in
the
society
of
men
of
science
and
learning
like
monge
and
berthollet

after
the
peace
of
campo
formio
he
accompanied
his
chief
to
paris
where
an
incident
occurred
which
illustrates
well
the
character
of
the
two
men
the
minister
of
war
wanted
detailed
information
regarding
the
english
preparations
against
invasion
and
bonaparte
offered
to
send
his
aidedecamp
as
a
spy
marmont
indignantly
refused
to
go
in
such
a
capacity
and
a
permanent
estrangement
nearly
took
place
their
standards
had
nothing
in
common
in
the
one
honour
could
conquer
ambition
in
the
other
ambition
knew
no
rules
of
honour

however
their
lust
for
glory
brought
them
together
again
and
marmont
sailed
with
the
egyptian
expedition
he
was
despatched
north
to
command
alexandria
after
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
where
his
guns
had
played
so
important
a
part
in
shattering
the
mamelukes
later
he
was
entrusted
with
the
control
of
the
whole
of
the
mediterranean
littoral
his
task
was
a
difficult
one
but
a
most
useful
training
for
a
young
commander
with
a
tiny
garrison
he
had
to
hold
the
important
town
of
alexandria
and
to
keep
in
order
a
large
province
to
organise
small
columns
to
repress
local
risings
to
make
his
own
arrangements
for
raising
money
to
pay
his
troops
and
consequently
to
reorganise
the
fiscal
system
of
the
country
to
reconstruct
canals
and
to
improvise
flotillas
of
barges
to
supply
alexandria
with
provisions
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
remnant
of
the
french
fleet
and
thus
to
try
to
establish
communications
with
europe
he
was
responsible
for
resisting
any
attempt
at
invasion
by
the
turks
or
the
english
and
it
was
mainly
owing
to
his
measures
that
when
the
former
landed
at
aboukir
they
were
destroyed
before
they
could
march
inland
while
his
comrades
were
gaining
military
glory
in
syria
he
was
fighting
the
plague
at
alexandria
learning
that
patient
attention
to
detail
and
careful
supervision
of
the
health
of
his
troops
were
as
important
attributes
of
a
commander
as
dash
and
courage
in
the
field

marmont
quitted
egypt
with
joy
he
had
learned
many
useful
lessons
but
like
the
rest
of
the
army
he
hated
the
country
and
the
half
oriental
life
and
above
all
as
he
said
seeing
a
campaign
and
not
taking
part
in
it
was
a
horrible
punishment
on
returning
to
paris
his
time
was
fully
occupied
in
winning
over
the
artillery
to
bonaparte
he
had
no
false
ideas
on
the
subject
for
as
he
said
to
junot
before
the
egyptian
expedition
you
will
see
my
friend
that
on
his
return
bonaparte
will
seize
the
crown
as
his
reward
the
first
consul
gave
him
the
choice
of
the
command
of
the
artillery
of
the
guard
or
a
seat
as
councillor
of
state
jealous
of
lannes
and
flattered
by
the
title
he
chose
the
councillorship
in
which
capacity
he
was
employed
on
the
war
committee
and
entrusted
with
the
reorganisation
of
the
artillery
his
first
business
was
to
provide
a
proper
train
to
ensure
the
quick
and
easy
mobilisation
of
the
artillery
after
the
marengo
campaign
he
took
in
hand
the
reform
of
the
matériel
too
many
different
types
of
guns
existed
marmont
reorganised
both
the
field
and
the
fortress
artillery
replacing
the
seven
old
types
of
guns
by
threenamely
sixpounders
twelvepounders
and
twentyfour
pounders
he
also
reduced
the
different
types
of
wheels
for
gun
carriages
limbers
and
wagons
from
twentyfour
to
eight
thus
greatly
simplifying
the
provision
of
ammunition
and
the
work
of
repair
in
the
field

the
marengo
campaign
added
to
his
prestige
as
an
artillery
officer
it
was
owing
to
his
ingenuity
that
the
guns
were
unmounted
and
pulled
by
hand
in
cradles
up
the
steep
side
of
the
mountain
and
thus
safely
taken
over
the
st
bernard
pass
it
was
his
ingenious
brain
which
suggested
the
paving
of
the
road
with
straw
whereby
the
muchneeded
artillery
was
forwarded
to
lannes
by
night
without
any
casualties
right
under
the
batteries
of
the
fortress
of
bard
it
was
owing
to
his
foresight
that
the
reserve
battery
of
guns
captured
from
the
enemy
saved
the
day
at
marengo
by
containing
the
austrians
while
desaixs
fresh
troops
were
being
deployed
and
it
was
the
tremendous
effect
of
his
massed
battery
which
gave
kellermann
the
opportunity
for
his
celebrated
charge
the
first
consul
marked
his
approval
by
promoting
marmont
a
general
of
division
and
thus
at
the
age
of
twentysix
the
young
artillery
officer
had
nearly
reached
the
head
of
his
profession
after
marengo
he
continued
his
work
of
reorganisation
but
before
the
end
of
the
year
he
was
once
again
in
italy
this
time
as
a
divisional
commander
under
brune
who
being
no
great
strategist
was
glad
to
avail
himself
of
the
brains
of
the
first
consuls
favourite
it
was
thanks
to
marmonts
plans
that
the
french
army
successfully
crossed
the
mincio
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
and
forced
on
him
the
armistice
of
treviso
when
moreaus
victory
of
hohenlinden
induced
austria
to
make
peace
the
general
was
sent
to
reorganise
the
italian
artillery
on
the
same
principles
he
had
laid
down
for
the
french
he
established
an
immense
foundry
and
arsenal
at
pavia
and
the
excellence
of
his
plans
was
clearly
proved
in
many
a
later
campaign
from
italy
he
was
recalled
to
paris
in
september
1802
as
inspectorgeneral
of
artillery
he
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
his
new
duties
but
found
time
to
increase
his
scientific
knowledge
and
to
keep
himself
up
to
date
with
everything
in
the
political
and
scientific
world
he
keenly
supported
fultons
invention
of
the
steamboat
and
pressed
it
on
the
first
consul
and
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
was
convinced
that
if
the
emperor
had
adopted
the
invention
the
invasion
of
england
would
have
been
successful

the
year
1804
brought
him
the
delight
of
his
first
important
command
in
february
he
was
appointed
chief
of
the
corps
of
the
army
of
the
ocean
which
was
stationed
in
holland
he
entered
on
his
task
with
his
usual
fervour
his
first
step
was
to
make
friends
with
all
the
dutch
officials
and
thus
to
secure
the
smooth
working
of
his
commissariat
and
supply
departments
then
he
turned
to
the
actual
training
of
his
troops
for
this
purpose
he
obtained
permission
to
hold
a
big
camp
of
instruction
where
all
the
divisions
of
his
corps
were
massed
so
successful
was
this
experiment
that
it
became
an
annual
institution
but
amid
all
the
pleasure
of
this
congenial
work
came
the
bitter
moment
when
he
found
the
name
of
so
mediocre
a
soldier
as
bessières
included
in
the
list
of
the
new
marshals
and
his
own
omitted
it
was
a
sore
blow
and
his
appointment
as
colonelgeneral
of
the
horse
chasseurs
and
grand
eagle
of
the
legion
of
honour
did
little
to
mitigate
it
the
emperor
careful
as
ever
to
stimulate
devotion
later
explained
to
him
that
a
dashing
officer
like
himself
would
have
plenty
of
opportunities
of
gaining
distinction
while
this
was
bessièress
only
chance
but
in
spite
of
this
the
neglect
rankled
and
from
that
day
he
was
no
longer
the
blindly
devoted
follower
of
napoleon

on
the
outbreak
of
the
austrian
war
marmonts
corps
became
the
second
corps
of
the
grand
army
in
the
operations
ending
in
ulm
the
second
corps
formed
part
of
the
left
wing
after
the
capitulation
it
was
detached
to
cover
the
french
communications
from
an
attack
from
the
direction
of
styria
in
the
summer
of
the
following
year
marmont
was
despatched
as
commanderinchief
to
dalmatia
where
he
spent
the
next
five
years
of
his
life
dalmatia
had
been
ceded
to
france
by
the
treaty
of
pressburg
in
napoleons
eyes
the
importance
of
the
province
lay
in
the
harbour
of
cattaro
which
he
regarded
as
an
outlet
to
the
balkan
peninsula
his
intention
was
to
get
possession
of
montenegro
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
ali
pacha
of
janina
and
the
sultan
and
oppose
the
policy
of
russia
but
the
russians
and
montenegrins
had
seized
cattaro
and
were
threatening
to
besiege
ragusa
it
was
to
meet
this
situation
that
the
emperor
in
july
1806
hastily
sent
his
former
favourite
to
dalmatia
the
new
commanderinchief
found
himself
as
in
egypt
faced
with
the
difficulty
of
supply
half
the
army
was
in
hospital
from
want
of
proper
nourishment
and
commonsense
sanitation
having
by
his
care
of
his
men
refilled
his
battalions
he
advanced
boldly
on
the
enemy
and
drove
them
out
of
their
positions
this
punishment
kept
the
montenegrins
quiet
for
the
future
and
the
russians
fell
back
on
cattaro
from
there
he
was
unable
to
drive
them
owing
to
the
guns
of
their
fleet
and
it
was
not
till
the
treaty
of
tilsit
that
the
french
got
possession
of
the
coveted
port
the
french
commanders
chief
difficulty
in
administering
his
province
was
that
which
is
felt
in
all
uncivilised
countries
the
difficulty
of
holding
down
a
hostile
population
where
roads
do
not
exist
otherwise
his
just
but
stern
rule
admirably
suited
the
townsmen
of
the
little
cities
on
the
coast
while
order
was
kept
among
the
hill
tribes
by
making
their
headmen
responsible
for
their
behaviour
and
by
aiding
them
in
attacking
the
turks
who
had
seized
certain
tracts
of
territory
and
maltreated
the
inhabitants
but
it
was
not
gratitude
which
kept
the
hillmen
quiet
so
much
as
the
miles
of
new
roads
on
which
the
french
commander
employed
his
army
when
not
engaged
on
expeditions
against
restless
marauders
during
his
years
in
the
dalmatian
provinces
marmont
constructed
more
than
two
hundred
miles
of
roads
with
the
result
that
his
small
force
was
able
with
ease
to
hold
down
the
long
narrow
mountainous
province
by
the
speed
with
which
he
could
mobilise
his
punitive
expeditions
moreover
owing
to
the
increased
means
of
traffic
the
peasants
were
able
to
find
a
market
for
their
goods
and
the
prosperity
of
the
country
increased
beyond
belief
with
prosperity
came
contentment
manufactures
were
established
and
the
mines
and
the
other
natural
resources
of
the
country
were
exploited
to
advantage
as
the
emperor
of
austria
said
to
metternich
in
1817
when
visiting
the
province
it
is
a
great
pity
that
marshal
marmont
was
not
two
or
three
years
longer
in
dalmatia

the
years
spent
at
ragusa
were
probably
the
happiest
of
marmonts
life
his
successful
work
was
recognised
in
1808
when
the
emperor
created
him
duke
of
ragusa
each
day
was
full
of
interest
he
was
head
of
the
civil
administration
and
of
the
judicial
and
fiscal
departments
as
commanderinchief
he
was
responsible
for
the
health
welfare
and
discipline
of
the
troops
and
for
the
military
works
which
were
being
erected
to
protect
the
province
from
austrian
aggression
he
had
his
special
hobbythe
roads
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
business
he
found
time
to
put
himself
in
the
hands
of
a
tutor
and
to
work
ten
hours
a
day
at
history
chemistry
and
anatomy
to
aid
him
in
his
studies
he
collected
a
travelling
library
of
six
hundred
volumes
which
accompanied
him
in
all
his
later
campaigns

the
austrian
campaign
of
1809
called
him
from
these
congenial
labours
to
the
even
more
congenial
operations
of
war
the
duty
of
the
army
of
dalmatia
was
to
attempt
to
cut
off
the
archduke
john
on
his
retirement
from
italy
but
the
duke
of
ragusa
had
not
sufficient
troops
to
carry
out
this
operation
successfully
although
he
effected
a
junction
with
the
army
of
italy
after
a
succession
of
small
engagements
the
united
armies
found
themselves
on
the
danube
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
battle
of
wagram
in
reserve
during
the
greater
part
of
the
battle
marmonts
corps
was
entrusted
with
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
unfortunately
either
from
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
situation
or
from
jealousy
their
commander
refused
to
allow
davout
to
cooperate
with
him
and
consequently
although
he
overtook
the
austrians
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
hold
them
till
other
divisions
of
the
army
came
up
however
at
the
end
of
the
operations
napoleon
created
him
marshal
but
the
duke
of
ragusas
joy
at
receiving
this
gift
was
tempered
by
the
way
it
was
given
for
the
emperor
angry
doubtless
at
the
escape
of
the
austrians
told
him
i
have
given
you
your
nomination
and
i
have
great
pleasure
in
bestowing
on
you
this
proof
of
my
affection
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
incurred
the
reproach
of
listening
rather
to
my
affection
than
to
your
right
to
this
distinction
you
have
plenty
of
intelligence
but
there
are
needed
for
war
qualities
in
which
you
are
still
lacking
and
which
you
must
work
to
acquire
between
ourselves
you
have
not
yet
done
enough
to
justify
entirely
my
choice
at
the
same
time
i
am
confident
that
i
shall
have
reason
to
congratulate
myself
on
having
nominated
you
and
that
you
will
justify
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
army
unkind
critics
of
the
three
new
marshals
created
after
wagram
said
that
napoleon
having
lost
lannes
wanted
to
get
the
small
change
for
him
but
it
is
only
fair
to
remember
that
though
macdonald
marmont
and
oudinot
were
all
inferior
to
lannes
they
were
quite
as
good
soldiers
as
some
of
the
original
marshals

after
peace
was
declared
the
new
marshal
returned
to
dalmatia
and
took
up
the
threads
of
his
old
life
he
had
won
the
respect
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
fear
of
their
foes
the
turks
and
save
for
an
occasional
expedition
against
the
brigands
or
friction
with
the
fiscal
officials
his
time
passed
peaceably
and
pleasantly
but
in
1811
he
was
recalled
to
paris
to
receive
orders
before
starting
on
a
new
sphere
of
duty
masséna
the
spoiled
child
of
victory
had
met
his
match
at
torres
vedras
and
napoleon
blaming
the
man
instead
of
the
system
had
determined
to
try
a
fresh
leader
for
the
army
opposing
sir
arthur
wellesley
the
emperor
did
not
hide
from
himself
the
fact
that
in
selecting
marmont
he
was
making
an
experiment
for
he
told
st
cyr
that
he
had
sent
marmont
to
spain
because
he
had
plenty
of
talent
but
that
he
had
not
yet
tested
to
the
full
his
force
of
character
and
he
added
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
judge
of
that
for
now
he
is
left
to
his
own
resources
the
new
commander
of
the
army
of
portugal
set
out
with
the
full
confidence
that
the
task
was
not
beyond
his
powers
and
with
the
promise
of
the
viceroyalty
of
one
of
the
five
provinces
into
which
spain
was
to
be
divided
he
arrived
at
the
front
two
days
after
the
battle
of
fuentes
donoro
and
found
a
very
different
state
of
affairs
from
what
he
had
expected
the
country
was
a
howling
waste
covered
with
fierce
guerillas
the
french
army
so
long
accustomed
to
success
was
absolutely
demoralised
by
repeated
disappointments
and
defeats
it
was
necessary
to
take
stringent
measures
to
restore
the
morale
of
the
troops
before
he
could
call
on
them
to
face
once
more
the
infantry
whose
fire
was
the
most
murderous
of
all
the
armies
of
europe

accordingly
he
withdrew
from
the
portuguese
frontier
put
his
army
into
cantonments
round
salamanca
and
set
to
work
on
the
difficult
task
of
collecting
supplies
from
a
country
which
was
already
swept
bare
meanwhile
he
split
up
his
army
into
six
divisions
established
direct
communications
between
himself
and
the
divisional
officers
and
to
get
rid
of
the
grumblers
gave
leave
to
all
officers
who
so
desired
to
return
to
france
at
the
same
time
he
distributed
his
weak
battalions
among
the
other
corps
so
that
each
battalion
had
a
complement
of
seven
hundred
muskets
he
also
broke
up
the
weak
squadrons
and
batteries
and
brought
up
the
remainder
to
service
strength
scarcely
was
this
reorganisation
completed
when
soult
who
had
been
defeated
at
albuera
called
on
marmont
to
aid
him
in
saving
badajoz
in
spite
of
his
personal
dislike
for
the
duke
of
dalmatia
the
marshal
hurried
to
his
aid
and
for
the
time
the
important
fortress
was
saved
during
the
rest
of
the
summer
the
army
of
portugal
lay
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
holding
the
bridge
of
almaraz
and
thus
ready
at
any
moment
to
go
to
the
relief
of
badajoz
or
ciudad
rodrigo
the
two
keys
of
portugal
when
in
the
autumn
wellington
threatened
ciudad
rodrigo
the
marshal
calling
to
his
aid
dorsenne
who
commanded
in
northern
spain
at
the
successful
engagement
of
el
bodin
drove
back
the
advance
guard
of
the
angloportuguese
and
threw
a
large
quantity
of
provisions
into
the
fortress

the
year
1812
was
a
disastrous
one
for
the
french
arms
all
over
europe
the
emperor
attempted
to
direct
the
spanish
war
from
paris
in
his
desire
to
secure
all
southern
spain
he
stripped
marmonts
army
to
reinforce
suchet
in
his
conquest
of
valencia
accordingly
in
january
the
marshal
was
powerless
to
stop
wellingtons
dash
at
ciudad
rodrigo
and
was
unable
later
to
make
a
sufficient
demonstration
in
portugal
to
relieve
the
pressure
on
badajoz
so
both
the
fortresses
fell
and
the
duke
of
ragusa
was
blamed
for
the
emperors
mistake
he
was
thereafter
called
upon
to
try
to
stem
the
victorious
advance
of
the
english
into
spain
short
of
men
of
horses
and
of
supplies
he
did
wonders
thanks
to
his
strenuous
efforts
supplies
were
massed
at
salamanca
good
food
and
careful
nursing
emptied
the
hospitals
and
filled
the
ranks
and
the
cavalry
was
supplied
with
remounts
by
dismounting
the
field
officers
of
the
infantry
the
month
of
july
saw
an
interesting
duel
round
salamanca
between
marmont
and
wellington
the
two
armies
were
very
nearly
equal
in
numbers
the
french
having
fortyseven
thousand
men
and
the
english
fortyfour
thousand
the
french
had
the
advantage
of
a
broad
base
with
lines
of
retreat
either
on
burgos
or
madrid
the
english
had
to
cover
their
single
line
of
communication
which
ran
through
ciudad
rodrigo
the
french
had
the
further
advantage
that
their
infantry
marched
better
than
the
english
owing
to
these
causes
their
commander
was
so
far
able
to
outgeneral
his
adversary
that
by
july
22nd
he
was
actually
threatening
the
english
line
of
retreat
but
a
tactical
mistake
threw
away
all
these
strategic
advantages
in
his
eagerness
he
allowed
his
leading
division
to
get
too
extended
forgetting
that
he
was
performing
the
dangerous
operation
of
a
flank
march
wellington
waited
till
he
saw
his
opportunity
and
then
threw
himself
on
the
weak
french
centre
and
cut
the
french
army
in
half
thus
proving
his
famous
dictum
that
the
great
general
is
not
he
who
makes
fewest
mistakes
but
he
who
can
best
take
advantage
of
the
mistakes
of
his
enemy
marmont
saw
his
error
as
soon
as
the
english
attack
began
but
a
wound
from
a
cannon
ball
disabled
him
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
action
this
injury
to
his
arm
was
so
serious
that
he
had
to
throw
up
his
command
and
return
to
france
and
for
the
whole
of
the
next
year
he
had
to
wear
his
arm
in
a
sling

napoleon
furious
with
the
marshal
for
his
illsuccess
most
unjustly
blamed
him
for
not
waiting
for
reinforcements
these
actually
arrived
two
days
after
the
battle
joseph
however
had
told
him
distinctly
that
he
was
not
going
to
send
him
any
help
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
tactical
blunders
marmont
would
undoubtedly
have
caused
wellington
to
fall
back
on
portugal
but
in
1812
the
exigencies
of
war
demanded
that
france
should
send
forth
every
soldier
and
accordingly
in
march
the
duke
of
ragusa
was
gazetted
to
the
command
of
the
sixth
corps
which
was
forming
in
the
valley
of
the
maine
on
taking
up
this
command
he
found
that
his
corps
was
mainly
composed
of
sailors
drafted
from
the
useless
ships
and
of
recruits
while
his
artillery
had
no
horses
and
his
cavalry
did
not
exist
with
these
raw
troops
he
had
to
undergo
some
difficult
experiences
at
lützen
and
bautzen
but
as
the
campaign
progressed
he
moulded
them
into
shape
and
his
divisions
did
good
service
in
the
fighting
in
silesia
and
round
dresden
at
the
rout
after
the
battle
of
leipzig
marmont
like
most
of
the
higher
officers
of
the
army
thought
more
of
his
personal
safety
than
of
his
honour
and
allowed
himself
to
be
escorted
from
the
field
by
his
staff
officers

but
in
the
campaign
of
1814
he
made
amends
for
all
his
former
blunders
and
his
fighting
record
stands
high
indeed
at
saintdizier
la
rothière
arcissuraube
nogent
sézanne
and
champaubert
he
held
his
own
or
defeated
the
enemy
with
inferior
numbers
in
every
case
once
only
at
laon
did
he
allow
himself
to
be
surprised
when
the
end
came
it
was
marmont
who
at
josephs
command
had
to
hand
over
paris
to
the
allies
thereafter
he
was
faced
with
a
terrible
problem
his
army
was
sick
of
fighting
officers
and
men
demanded
peace
he
had
to
decide
whether
his
duty
to
napoleon
was
the
same
as
his
duty
to
france
unfortunately
he
acted
hurriedly
and
without
informing
the
emperor
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
enemy
the
result
was
farreaching
for
his
conduct
showed
alexander
that
the
army
was
sick
of
war
and
would
no
longer
fight
for
napoleon
it
thus
cut
away
the
ground
of
the
commissioners
who
were
trying
by
trading
on
the
prestige
of
the
emperor
and
the
fear
of
his
name
to
persuade
the
czar
to
accept
napoleons
abdication
on
behalf
of
his
son
the
king
of
rome
the
marshals
enemies
put
down
his
action
to
illwill
against
the
emperor
for
withholding
for
so
long
the
marshalate
and
for
his
treatment
after
salamanca
but
marmont
asserted
that
it
was
patriotism
which
dictated
his
action
and
further
maintained
that
napoleon
himself
ought
to
have
approved
of
his
action
quoting
a
conversation
held
in
1813
if
the
enemy
invaded
france
said
the
emperor
and
seized
the
heights
of
montmartre
you
would
naturally
believe
that
the
safety
of
your
country
would
command
you
to
leave
me
and
if
you
did
so
you
would
be
a
good
frenchman
a
brave
man
a
conscientious
man
but
not
a
man
of
honour

the
defection
of
the
duke
of
ragusa
came
as
a
bitter
blow
to
napoleon
that
marmont
should
do
such
a
thing
cried
the
fallen
emperor
a
man
with
whom
i
have
shared
my
bread
whom
i
drew
out
of
obscurity
ungrateful
villain
he
will
be
more
unhappy
than
i
the
prophecy
was
true
the
duke
of
ragusa
stuck
to
the
bourbons
and
refused
to
join
napoleon
during
the
hundred
days
going
to
ghent
as
chief
of
the
military
household
of
the
exiled
king
he
returned
with
louis
to
paris
and
was
made
majorgeneral
of
the
royal
guard
and
a
peer
of
france
in
which
capacity
he
sat
as
one
of
the
judges
who
condemned
ney
to
death
but
men
looked
askance
at
him
and
from
1817
he
lived
in
retirement
occupying
his
leisure
in
experimental
farming
with
great
injury
to
his
purse
for
his
elaborate
scheme
of
housing
his
sheep
in
threestoried
barns
and
clothing
them
in
coats
made
of
skin
was
most
unprofitable
retirement
was
a
bitter
blow
to
the
keen
soldier
but
the
bourbon
monarchs
clearly
understood
that
the
deserter
of
napoleon
and
the
judge
of
marshal
ney
could
never
be
popular
with
the
army

still
when
in
july
1830
discontent
was
seething
charles
x
remembered
his
sterling
qualities
and
summoned
him
to
paris
as
governor
of
the
city
it
was
an
unfortunate
nomination
for
the
marshals
unpopularity
weakened
the
bonds
of
discipline
whilst
his
eagerness
to
show
his
loyalty
caused
him
to
adopt
such
measures
as
the
king
ordered
irrespective
of
their
military
worth
in
vain
he
warned
the
king
that
this
was
not
a
revolt
but
a
revolution
the
counsels
of
polignac
were
all
powerful
the
marshals
political
suggestions
were
unheeded
and
his
military
plans
overridden
the
mass
of
the
troops
of
the
line
kept
for
long
hours
without
food
in
the
streets
mutinied
and
went
over
to
the
populace
while
those
who
remained
loyal
and
the
royal
guards
instead
of
being
concentrated
and
protected
by
batteries
of
artillery
were
frittered
away
in
useless
expeditions
into
outlying
parts
of
the
city
after
two
days
fighting
the
royalists
had
to
evacuate
the
city
thus
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
marshal
once
more
to
hand
over
paris
to
the
foes
of
those
to
whom
his
allegiance
was
due

the
duke
of
ragusa
accompanied
charles
to
cherbourg
and
quitted
france
in
august
1830
never
to
return
the
remainder
of
his
life
was
spent
in
foreign
countries
he
made
vienna
his
headquarters
and
from
there
took
journeys
to
russia
turkey
egypt
and
italy
deeply
interested
in
science
and
history
he
devoted
his
leisure
to
writing
his
memoirs
to
works
on
military
science
philanthropy
and
travel
thus
occupied
though
an
exile
from
his
country
he
lived
a
busy
active
and
on
the
whole
useful
life
till
death
overtook
him
at
vienna
in
1852

marshal
marmont
has
been
called
one
of
napoleons
failures
but
this
criticism
is
onesided
and
unjust
true
it
is
that
his
name
is
intimately
connected
with
the
failure
in
spain
and
with
the
fall
of
the
empire
but
to
judge
his
career
by
these
two
instances
and
to
neglect
his
other
work
is
to
generalise
from
an
insufficient
and
casual
basis
the
duke
of
ragusa
owed
his
marshalate
like
many
others
to
his
intimacy
with
napoleon
but
unlike
several
of
the
marshals
he
really
earned
his
bâton
his
great
powers
of
organisation
so
unstintedly
given
to
the
rearmament
of
france
and
italy
and
his
work
of
regeneration
in
dalmatia
together
with
his
military
operations
in
styria
spain
and
during
the
campaign
of
1814
mark
him
out
as
a
soldier
of
great
capabilities
organisation
was
his
strong
point
but
he
also
possessed
great
physical
bravery
and
many
of
the
qualities
of
a
commander
his
love
for
his
profession
was
great
and
not
only
had
he
graduated
under
napoleons
eye
but
much
of
his
time
was
spent
in
studying
his
calling
from
a
scientific
and
historical
point
of
view
as
a
strategist
he
probably
stood
as
high
as
any
of
his
fellow
marshals
and
his
operations
in
dalmatia
spain
and
france
deserve
the
careful
study
of
all
students
of
military
history
but
he
failed
as
a
tactician
salamanca
and
laon
prove
not
only
that
he
made
mistakes
and
had
not
the
faculty
of
retrieving
his
errors
but
above
all
he
lacked
the
capacity
of
seizing
on
the
mistakes
of
his
enemy
in
1811
at
el
bodin
he
had
wellington
at
his
mercy
but
he
hesitated
to
strike
for
he
could
not
believe
his
great
opponent
could
make
the
glaring
error
of
leaving
his
divisions
unsupported
again
and
again
during
his
career
he
showed
that
lack
of
resolution
which
was
responsible
for
his
last
catastrophe
in
paris
where
he
allowed
his
own
judgment
to
be
overruled
by
king
charless
personal
desires
in
a
word
he
had
the
gift
of
a
great
quartermastergeneral
rather
than
of
a
commanderinchief
as
a
man
the
marshals
character
is
an
interesting
study
in
youth
the
thirst
for
personal
glory
and
ambition
were
the
dominant
traits
and
what
stability
he
had
he
drew
from
his
proud
sense
of
honour
which
refused
to
allow
him
to
take
plunder
or
bribes
but
responsibility
developed
many
latent
qualities
the
desire
to
keep
his
troops
efficient
led
him
to
pay
especial
care
to
their
physical
wellbeing
and
from
doing
this
as
a
duty
he
learned
to
do
it
as
a
labour
of
love
as
time
went
on
desire
for
personal
glory
became
merged
in
keen
delight
in
the
glory
of
france
and
hence
grew
up
a
patriotism
which
rightly
or
wrongly
led
to
the
scenes
of
1814
and
1830
misfortune
also
had
its
share
in
the
enlarging
of
his
character
his
unhappy
marriage
his
bitterness
at
the
withholding
of
the
marshalate
his
unpopularity
after
1814
led
him
to
remember
his
fathers
warning
that
success
is
not
everything
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
development
of
those
scientific
and
literary
abilities
to
which
he
had
always
shown
strong
leanings
hence
though
the
blight
of
his
marriage
and
his
unpopularity
arising
from
his
desertion
of
napoleon
embittered
him
and
caused
his
memoirs
to
teem
with
cutting
descriptions
of
his
contemporaries
and
former
friends
his
old
age
though
spent
in
exile
was
soothed
by
congenial
work
which
proved
that
to
the
eye
of
a
general
he
united
the
accomplishments
of
a
scholar
and
the
heart
of
a
philanthropist

gabriel
suchet
marshal
duke
of
albufera


louis
gabriel
suchet
the
son
of
a
silk
manufacturer
was
born
at
lyons
on
march
2
1770
his
father
had
acquired
a
certain
eminence
by
his
discoveries
in
his
profession
and
had
occupied
a
prominent
place
in
the
municipality
of
lyons
louis
gabriel
who
received
a
sound
education
at
the
college
of
isle
barbe
early
showed
that
he
inherited
his
fathers
gifts
of
organisation
and
research
in
1792
he
entered
a
corps
of
volunteer
cavalry
his
education
and
ability
soon
brought
him
to
the
front
and
after
two
years
service
he
became
lieutenantcolonel
of
the
eighteenth
demibrigade
in
which
capacity
he
took
part
in
the
siege
of
toulon
there
he
had
the
double
good
fortune
to
make
prisoner
general
ohara
the
english
governor
of
the
fortress
and
to
gain
the
friendship
of
bonaparte
suchet
and
his
brother
accompanied
the
future
emperor
on
many
a
pleasant
picnic
and
the
three
were
well
known
among
a
certain
class
of
marseilles
society
but
this
was
but
a
passing
phase
and
soon
the
thirst
for
glory
called
the
young
soldier
to
sterner
things
the
campaigns
of
17945
in
the
maritime
alps
the
battle
of
loano
and
the
fierce
fights
in
1796
at
lodi
rivoli
arcola
and
castiglione
proved
colonel
suchets
undaunted
courage
and
ability
as
a
regimental
commander
in
1797
for
his
brilliant
conduct
at
neumarkt
in
styria
bonaparte
gazetted
him
general
of
brigade
in
his
new
capacity
suchet
proved
that
he
could
not
only
carry
out
orders
but
act
in
semiindependence
as
a
column
commander
and
as
a
reward
for
his
success
in
switzerland
under
general
brune
he
had
the
honour
of
carrying
twentythree
captured
stands
of
colours
to
the
directory
at
brunes
request
he
was
sent
back
to
switzerland
to
act
as
chief
of
his
staff
suchet
had
to
a
great
extent
those
qualities
which
go
to
make
an
ideal
staff
officer
he
had
a
cheery
smile
and
word
for
everybody
and
his
tall
upright
figure
and
genial
face
inspired
confidence
in
officers
and
men
alike
as
a
regimental
commander
and
a
general
of
brigade
he
had
a
sound
knowledge
of
the
working
of
small
and
large
corps
and
his
early
experience
as
a
cavalry
officer
and
his
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
officers
of
the
artillery
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
drafting
orders
and
his
tact
and
energy
commended
him
to
all
with
whom
he
served
but
above
all
he
had
the
secret
of
inspiring
those
around
him
with
his
own
vehemence
and
enthusiasm
brune
joubert
masséna
and
moreau
all
proved
his
worth
and
moreau
only
expressed
the
opinion
of
the
others
when
he
said
to
a
friend
your
general
is
one
of
the
best
staff
officers
in
all
the
armies
of
france
as
general
of
division
suchet
acted
as
chief
of
the
staff
to
joubert
in
italy
in
1799
later
in
the
year
he
commanded
one
of
the
divisions
of
the
army
of
the
alps
under
masséna
and
fought
against
the
celebrated
suvaroff
but
when
joubert
was
hurriedly
despatched
to
italy
he
at
once
demanded
to
have
suchet
as
chief
of
the
staff
on
jouberts
death
at
the
battle
of
novi
suchet
served
masséna
in
a
similar
capacity
the
latter
was
so
delighted
with
him
that
he
wanted
to
carry
him
off
to
the
army
of
the
rhine
but
in
that
disastrous
year
men
of
ability
could
not
be
spared
and
bernadotte
as
minister
of
war
retained
him
in
italy
to
aid
the
new
commanderinchief
with
his
clear
insight
as
the
public
weal
demands
when
masséna
took
command
of
the
army
of
italy
in
march
he
detached
suchet
to
cover
france
on
the
line
of
the
var
while
he
with
the
rest
of
the
army
threw
himself
into
genoa
the
commanderinchief
had
absolute
confidence
in
his
lieutenant
he
had
tried
him
again
and
again
in
the
swiss
campaign
and
when
suchet
had
by
a
marvellous
march
escaped
the
tangles
of
the
russians
his
only
comment
had
been
i
was
quite
sure
he
would
bring
me
back
his
brigade
the
young
general
acted
once
again
up
to
his
reputation
and
evinced
those
resources
in
difficulty
and
that
resolution
in
adversity
which
so
marked
his
career
with
a
mere
handful
of
troops
by
his
energy
and
tactical
ability
he
stemmed
the
flood
of
the
austrian
invasion
on
the
var
and
when
napoleon
debouched
through
the
st
bernard
pass
on
the
enemys
rear
by
a
masterly
return
to
the
initiative
he
drove
the
austrians
before
him
and
by
capturing
seven
thousand
prisoners
he
materially
lightened
the
first
consuls
difficulties
in
the
marengo
campaign
carnot
the
war
minister
wrote
to
him
in
eulogistic
terms
the
whole
republic
had
its
eyes
fixed
on
the
new
thermopylæ
your
bravery
was
as
great
and
more
successful
than
that
of
the
spartans
but
in
spite
of
this
feat
of
arms
and
the
unselfish
way
he
disengaged
dupont
from
his
difficulties
at
the
crossing
of
the
mincio
in
the
campaign
which
followed
marengo
suchet
found
himself
neglected
and
passed
over
when
the
emperor
distributed
his
new
honours
and
rewards
in
spite
of
his
former
friendship
and
the
remembrance
of
many
a
pleasant
day
spent
together
in
earlier
years
napoleon
could
not
forgive
his
stern
unbending
republicanism
he
knew
his
force
of
character
too
well
to
think
he
could
influence
his
opinions
by
mere
honours
and
he
determined
to
see
if
he
could
conquer
him
by
neglect
after
holding
the
office
of
inspectorgeneral
of
infantry
suchet
found
himself
in
1803
sent
to
the
camp
of
boulogne
as
a
mere
divisional
commander
in
soults
army
corps
in
the
same
capacity
he
loyally
served
under
lannes
in
the
austrian
campaign
of
1805
and
distinguished
himself
at
ulm
and
austerlitz
where
his
division
had
the
good
fortune
to
break
the
russian
centre
in
the
following
year
at
saalfeld
and
jena
he
added
to
his
reputation
and
the
emperor
did
him
the
honour
of
bivouacking
in
the
middle
of
his
division
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
jena
pultusk
and
eylau
bore
witness
to
his
bravery
and
address
on
the
battlefield
and
napoleon
began
to
relent
for
his
share
of
the
victory
of
austerlitz
the
emperor
had
created
him
grand
eagle
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
presented
him
with
twenty
thousand
francs
in
august
1807
he
gave
him
the
temporary
command
of
the
fifth
corps
a
few
months
later
he
gazetted
him
chevalier
of
the
iron
crown
and
in
march
1808
made
him
a
count
of
the
empire
in
1807
suchet
married
one
of
the
clarys
a
relative
of
joseph
bonapartes
wife
and
thus
to
a
certain
extent
bound
himself
to
the
napoleonic
dynasty
still
it
was
only
as
a
divisional
commander
of
the
fifth
corps
under
lannes
that
in
1808
he
entered
spain
the
scene
of
his
glory
but
when
the
war
brought
to
light
the
poor
quality
of
many
of
the
marshals
and
the
approaching
conflict
with
austria
caused
him
to
withdraw
his
best
lieutenants
to
the
danube
napoleon
bethought
him
of
his
new
relative
and
former
comrade
after
the
siege
of
saragossa
he
gave
him
the
command
of
the
third
corps
now
known
as
the
army
of
aragon
suchets
hour
of
probation
had
at
last
arrived
he
had
so
far
shown
himself
an
excellent
interpreter
of
the
ideas
of
others
a
man
of
energy
and
resource
in
carrying
out
orders
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
he
could
rise
to
the
height
of
thinking
and
acting
for
himself
in
the
plain
of
higher
strategy

from

engraving
by
pollet

the
situation
the
new
general
was
called
on
to
meet
might
have
depressed
a
weaker
man
the
third
corps
or
army
of
aragon
had
been
severely
shaken
by
the
long
stubborn
siege
of
saragossa
many
of
its
best
officers
and
men
were
dead
or
invalided
to
france
the
ranks
were
full
of
raw
recruits
who
had
not
yet
felt
the
bit
of
discipline
there
were
no
magazines
the
mens
pay
was
months
in
arrear
the
morale
of
the
troops
was
bad
but
the
general
was
told
that
he
must
expect
no
reinforcements
and
that
his
army
must
live
off
the
province
of
aragon
to
increase
his
difficulties
further
he
was
informed
that
while
lending
an
obedient
ear
to
all
commands
from
madrid
he
was
really
to
obey
orders
which
came
from
the
majorgeneral
in
paris
meanwhile
all
around
him
aragon
and
even
saragossa
were
seething
with
discontent
and
spanish
forces
elated
by
partial
success
were
springing
up
on
all
sides
it
was
thus
situated
that
suchet
had
his
first
experience
of
commanding
in
war
and
of
showing
that
success
depends
on
achieving
the
object
desired
with
the
means
at
hand
luckily
for
his
reputation
he
fulfilled
napoleons
dictum
that
a
general
should
above
all
be
coolheaded
in
order
to
estimate
things
at
their
value
he
must
not
be
moved
by
good
or
bad
news
the
sensations
which
he
daily
receives
must
be
so
classed
in
his
mind
that
each
should
occupy
its
appropriate
place
accordingly
he
at
once
grasped
the
vital
points
of
the
problem
and
strove
to
restore
the
morale
of
the
troops
so
that
he
might
be
in
a
position
to
meet
and
overcome
the
organised
forces
which
were
moving
against
him
his
first
step
was
to
hold
a
review
of
his
new
command
and
then
he
proceeded
to
visit
his
troops
in
their
quarters
and
to
get
into
personal
touch
with
the
officers
and
men
by
watching
them
at
their
company
and
battalion
drills
encouraging
them
and
supervising
the
interior
economy
of
the
various
regiments
and
brigades
his
reputation
and
his
personal
magnetism
soon
began
to
effect
a
complete
change
in
his
army
but
unfortunately
the
enemy
fighting
in
their
own
country
where
every
inhabitant
was
a
spy
on
their
side
knew
as
well
as
the
general
himself
the
exact
state
of
the
french
morale
the
position
of
every
unit
and
the
strength
of
each
company
and
squadron
so
accurate
was
their
information
that
on
one
occasion
when
a
battalion
was
despatched
on
a
reconnaissance
to
occupy
a
small
town
and
the
officer
commanding
demanded
a
thousand
rations
for
his
men
and
a
hundred
for
his
horse
the
alcalde
at
once
replied
i
know
that
i
must
furnish
rations
for
your
troops
but
i
will
only
supply
seven
hundred
and
eighty
for
the
men
and
sixty
for
the
horses
as
he
knew
beforehand
the
exact
number
of
men
and
horses
in
the
column

the
spanish
general
blake
with
this
wonderful
intelligence
organisation
at
his
command
called
together
his
troops
and
took
the
initiative
against
the
new
french
commander
by
advancing
towards
saragossa
suchet
recognising
the
importance
of
utilising
to
the
full
the
élan
which
the
french
soldier
always
derives
from
the
sense
of
attacking
advanced
to
meet
him
near
alcaniz
but
blake
easily
beat
off
the
french
attack
so
demoralised
was
the
army
of
aragon
that
on
the
following
night
when
a
drummer
cried
out
that
he
saw
the
spanish
cavalry
advancing
an
entire
infantry
regiment
threw
down
their
arms
before
this
phantom
charge
the
offender
was
brought
at
once
before
a
drumhead
court
martial
and
shot
but
with
troops
in
such
a
condition
the
french
commander
very
wisely
slowly
fell
back
the
next
day
towards
saragossa
the
situation
was
extremely
critical
a
hurried
retreat
would
have
roused
all
aragon
to
the
attack
fortunately
the
morale
of
the
spanish
troops
was
also
none
too
good
and
blake
waited
for
reinforcements
before
advancing
meanwhile
suchet
spent
every
hour
reorganising
his
army
visiting
with
speedy
punishment
all
slackness
encouraging
where
possible
by
praise
everywhere
showing
a
cheerfulness
and
confidence
he
was
far
from
feeling
every
day
the
troops
were
drilled
or
attended
musketry
practice
the
ordinary
routine
of
peace
was
carried
out
in
every
detail
and
the
civil
and
military
life
of
saragossa
showed
no
signs
of
the
greatness
of
this
crisis
meanwhile
care
and
attention
soon
showed
their
effect
and
when
three
weeks
later
the
enemy
appeared
at
maria
before
saragossa
suchet
had
under
his
command
a
force
full
of
zealous
desire
to
wipe
out
its
late
disgrace
and
absolutely
confident
in
its
general
fortunately
the
spanish
commander
by
attempting
a
wide
encircling
movement
weakened
his
numerical
superiority
and
suchet
as
usual
assuming
the
offensive
broke
the
spanish
centre
with
his
cavalry
hurled
his
infantry
into
the
gap
and
amid
a
terrific
thundershower
drove
the
spanish
from
the
field
the
battle
before
saragossa
saved
aragon
for
the
french
but
it
did
not
satisfy
their
commander
who
knew
that
to
move
swiftly
strike
vigorously
and
secure
all
the
fruits
of
victory
is
the
secret
of
successful
war
accordingly
with
his
now
elated
troops
he
pursued
the
enemy
and
attacked
them
at
belchite
the
spanish
morale
was
completely
broken
a
chance
shot
at
the
commencement
of
the
engagement
blew
up
an
ammunition
wagon
and
thereon
the
whole
army
turned
and
bolted
for
the
rest
of
the
war
no
regular
resistance
existed
in
aragon

the
battles
of
saragossa
and
belchite
marked
the
commencement
of
a
fresh
stage
in
the
conquest
of
eastern
spain
from
this
time
onwards
aragon
became
the
base
from
which
was
organised
the
conquest
of
catalonia
and
valencia
it
was
in
pursuance
of
this
scheme
that
suchets
next
task
was
the
organisation
of
the
civil
government
of
the
ancient
kingdom
of
aragon
fortunately
for
the
commanderinchief
the
old
local
patriotism
burnt
strong
in
the
hearts
of
the
aragonese
jealous
of
the
castilians
they
placed
their
love
of
aragon
far
above
their
love
of
spain
suchet
an
ardent
student
of
human
nature
was
quick
to
appreciate
how
to
turn
to
his
use
this
provincialism
loud
in
his
praises
of
their
stubborn
resistance
to
the
french
arms
he
approached
the
nobles
and
former
civil
servants
and
prayed
them
to
lend
him
their
help
in
restoring
the
former
glories
of
the
ancient
kingdom
of
aragon
meanwhile
the
people
of
the
towns
and
villages
were
propitiated
by
a
stern
justice
and
a
new
fiscal
system
which
while
it
drew
more
from
their
pockets
was
less
aggravating
and
inquisitorial
than
the
former
method
which
exacted
a
tax
on
the
sale
and
purchase
of
every
individual
article
meanwhile
the
needs
of
the
french
army
created
a
market
for
both
agricultural
produce
and
for
manufactured
articles
and
hence
both
the
urban
and
rural
populations
while
paying
heavier
taxes
made
greater
profits
than
formerly
such
was
the
ability
with
which
aragon
was
administered
that
a
province
which
even
in
its
most
prosperous
days
had
never
contributed
more
than
four
million
francs
to
the
spanish
treasury
was
able
to
produce
an
income
of
eight
million
francs
for
the
pay
of
the
troops
alone
without
counting
the
cost
of
military
operations
and
at
the
same
time
to
maintain
its
own
civil
servants
while
works
of
public
utility
were
commenced
in
saragossa
and
elsewhere

but
it
was
not
only
from
the
point
of
finance
that
suchet
proved
to
the
full
the
maxim
that
the
art
of
war
is
nothing
but
the
art
of
feeding
your
troops
his
military
operations
were
no
whit
less
remarkable
than
his
success
as
a
civil
administrator
immediately
after
belchite
he
swept
all
the
guerillas
out
of
aragon
and
by
a
carefully
thought
out
plan
of
garrisons
gave
the
country
that
peace
and
certainty
which
is
requisite
for
commerce
and
agriculture
alike
he
then
proceeded
to
wrest
from
the
enemy
the
important
fortresses
of
lerida
and
mequinenza
which
command
the
approaches
to
catalonia
suchets
conquest
of
aragon
catalonia
and
valencia
was
marked
by
a
succession
of
brilliant
sieges
lerida
mequinenza
tortosa
the
fort
of
san
felipe
the
col
of
balanquer
tarragona
sagunto
and
valencia
all
fell
before
his
conquering
arm
for
spain
had
to
be
won
piece
by
piece
each
forward
step
was
marked
by
a
siege
a
battle
to
defeat
the
relieving
force
the
fall
of
the
fortress
and
its
careful
restoration
as
a
base
for
the
next
advance
it
was
not
owing
to
any
weakness
or
want
of
precaution
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
that
suchet
thus
captured
all
the
noted
fortresses
of
central
spain
in
every
case
the
spaniards
fought
with
grim
determination
and
the
regular
spanish
armies
aided
by
swarms
of
guerillas
made
desperate
efforts
to
relieve
their
beleaguered
countrymen
but
the
french
success
was
due
to
the
qualities
of
their
general
with
a
patience
equal
to
that
of
marlborough
with
a
power
of
supervision
over
detail
like
that
of
his
great
chief
suchet
knew
exactly
how
to
pick
his
staff
and
how
far
to
trust
his
subordinates
above
all
he
had
absolute
selfcontrol
in
the
blackest
hour
he
never
gave
way
under
the
most
extreme
provocation
he
never
lost
his
temper
hence
his
own
troops
idolised
him
while
his
perfect
justice
impressed
itself
on
the
enemy
though
the
spanish
priests
were
teaching
the
catechism
in
every
village
that
it
was
ones
duty
to
love
all
men
except
the
french
that
it
was
not
only
lawful
but
ones
sacred
duty
to
kill
all
frenchmen
though
a
letter
was
captured
in
which
a
guerilla
chief
ordered
his
subordinates
to
make
every
effort
to
capture
madame
suchet
and
to
cut
her
throat
especially
because
she
was
pregnant
the
commanderinchief
kept
his
men
in
absolute
control
and
punished
with
the
greatest
severity
every
outrage
committed
by
his
troops

the
battle
and
siege
of
valencia
in
1811
were
the
crowning
success
of
his
career
and
brought
as
their
reward
the
longcoveted
marshals
bâton
and
the
title
of
duke
of
albufera
to
support
his
title
the
emperor
granted
him
half
a
million
francs
a
greater
sum
than
he
gave
to
any
other
of
his
paladins
the
year
1812
saw
the
marshal
busily
engaged
in
reorganising
the
province
of
valencia
on
the
lines
he
had
found
so
successful
in
aragon
but
his
work
there
had
never
time
to
take
root
the
necessities
of
the
russian
campaign
had
forced
napoleon
to
recall
from
spain
many
of
his
best
troops
while
the
successful
advance
of
wellington
on
madrid
showed
how
unstable
was
the
french
rule
it
was
the
province
of
valencia
alone
which
supplied
the
money
and
provisions
for
the
armies
which
reconquered
the
spanish
capital
for
king
joseph
in
1813
the
victorious
advance
of
wellington
and
the
battle
of
vittoria
compelled
suchet
to
evacuate
valencia
the
fall
of
pampeluna
caused
him
to
evacuate
aragon
deprived
of
all
his
trustworthy
troops
he
still
by
his
bold
counterattacks
delayed
the
advance
of
the
english
and
spaniards
under
bentinck
but
by
the
time
napoleon
abdicated
he
had
been
compelled
with
his
handful
of
men
to
fall
back
on
french
territory

under
the
restoration
the
marshal
was
retained
in
command
of
the
tenth
division
but
on
napoleons
return
from
elba
he
once
again
rejoined
his
old
leader
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
1808
the
emperor
greeted
him
most
cordially
marshal
suchet
he
said
you
have
grown
greatly
in
reputation
since
last
we
met
you
are
welcome
you
bring
with
you
glory
and
all
the
glamour
that
heroes
give
to
their
contemporaries
on
earth
the
marshal
was
at
once
sent
off
to
his
old
home
of
lyons
to
organise
there
out
of
nothing
an
army
which
was
to
cover
the
alps
men
there
were
in
plenty
but
the
arsenals
were
empty
still
the
marshal
with
ten
thousand
troops
beat
the
piedmontese
on
june
15th
and
a
few
days
afterwards
defeated
the
austrians
but
the
occupation
of
geneva
by
the
allies
forced
him
to
evacuate
savoy
and
fall
back
on
lyons
where
he
was
greeted
with
the
news
of
waterloo
under
the
second
restoration
the
marshal
never
appeared
in
public
life
and
died
at
the
château
of
saint
joseph
at
marseilles
on
january
3
1826

talking
to
omeara
at
st
helena
napoleon
said
of
the
generals
of
france
i
give
the
preference
to
suchet
before
his
time
masséna
was
the
first
at
another
time
he
said
of
him
it
is
a
pity
that
mortals
cannot
improvise
men
like
him
if
i
had
had
two
marshals
like
suchet
i
should
not
only
have
conquered
spain
but
have
kept
it
while
making
due
allowance
for
the
probability
that
the
emperor
was
influenced
in
this
speech
by
the
fact
that
suchet
alone
relieved
the
gloom
of
the
unsuccessful
war
in
spain
it
is
yet
abundantly
clear
that
the
marshal
was
a
commander
of
no
mean
ability
for
though
he
did
not
show
the
precocity
of
a
marmont
yet
as
napoleon
himself
said
suchet
was
a
man
whose
mind
and
character
increased
wonderfully

as
a
commanderinchief
though
acting
in
a
small
sphere
and
never
having
more
than
fifty
thousand
troops
under
his
command
he
showed
that
he
possessed
determination
insight
and
great
powers
of
organisation
from
the
first
he
saw
that
the
one
and
only
way
to
wear
down
the
spanish
resistance
was
to
capture
the
fortresses
hence
his
operations
were
twofoldthe
conduct
of
sieges
and
the
protection
of
his
convoys
from
the
guerillas
he
justified
his
reasoning
by
1812
he
had
captured
no
less
than
seventyseven
thousand
officers
and
men
and
fourteen
hundred
guns
and
had
pacified
aragon
valencia
and
part
of
catalonia
another
great
secret
of
his
success
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
knew
how
to
profit
by
victory
the
battle
of
belchite
followed
on
that
of
maria
no
sooner
was
lerida
captured
than
plans
were
made
to
take
mequinenza
and
before
that
fortress
was
captured
the
siege
train
for
tortosa
was
got
ready
profiting
by
the
depression
of
the
enemy
after
the
fall
of
tortosa
he
despatched
columns
to
capture
san
felipe
and
the
col
of
balanquer
thanks
to
his
former
training
as
chief
of
the
staff
the
marshal
was
able
with
his
own
hand
to
draw
up
all
the
smallest
regulations
for
siege
operations
and
for
the
government
of
aragon
and
valencia
the
gift
of
drafting
clear
and
concise
orders
and
the
intuition
with
which
he
chose
his
staff
and
column
commanders
explain
to
a
great
extent
the
reason
why
his
operations
in
catalonia
aragon
and
valencia
were
so
little
hampered
by
the
constant
guerilla
warfare
which
paralysed
the
other
french
commanders
in
spain
the
indefatigable
energy
with
which
he
made
himself
personally
acquainted
with
every
officer
under
his
command
and
his
knowledge
of
sympathy
with
and
care
for
his
soldiers
always
made
him
popular
while
the
burning
enthusiasm
which
he
knew
how
to
infuse
into
french
german
and
italian
alike
so
stimulated
his
troops
that
he
could
demand
almost
any
sacrifice
from
them
thus
it
was
that
he
himself
created
the
morale
which
enabled
him
again
and
again
to
conquer
against
overwhelming
odds

as
a
man
moderation
and
justice
lay
at
the
root
of
his
character
and
they
account
largely
for
his
success
as
a
statesman
he
had
the
difficult
task
of
administering
aragon
and
valencia
for
the
benefit
of
the
army
under
his
command
yet
he
was
remembered
not
with
hate
but
with
affection
by
the
people
of
those
countries
when
any
one
inquired
what
was
the
character
of
the
french
general
the
spaniards
would
reply
he
is
a
just
man
the
same
moderation
which
caused
him
to
save
tarragona
and
valencia
from
the
fury
of
his
troops
taught
him
to
devote
himself
to
the
welfare
of
his
temporary
subjects
and
caused
his
hospital
arrangements
to
receive
the
gratuitous
praise
of
the
spanish
and
english
commanders
at
saragossa
his
name
was
given
to
one
of
the
principal
streets
and
on
his
death
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
paid
for
masses
for
his
soul
while
the
king
of
spain
was
only
voicing
the
feelings
of
the
people
when
he
wrote
to
the
marshals
widow
that
everything
he
had
heard
in
spain
proved
how
deservedly
the
duke
of
albufera
had
gained
the
affections
of
the
people
of
valencia
and
aragon

laurent
gouvion
st
cyr
marshal


laurent
gouvion
st
cyr
the
son
of
a
small
landowner
of
toul
was
born
in
that
town
on
april
13
1764
his
father
who
was
a
gouvion
had
married
a
st
cyr
but
the
marriage
had
turned
out
an
unfortunate
one
and
soon
after
the
birth
of
the
young
laurent
a
separation
was
agreed
on
consequently
from
an
early
age
the
boy
lacked
a
mothers
care
his
father
many
of
whose
relations
were
in
the
artillery
desired
his
son
to
enter
the
army
and
with
that
object
in
view
sent
him
to
the
artillery
college
at
toul
but
at
the
age
of
eighteen
the
future
marshal
decided
to
abandon
the
career
of
arms
for
that
of
art
preferring
the
freedom
of
an
artists
life
to
the
dull
routine
of
garrison
service
taking
the
bit
between
his
teeth
early
in
1782
he
set
off
for
rome
which
he
made
his
headquarters
for
the
following
two
years
with
occasional
trips
as
far
as
sicily
the
year
1789
found
laurent
gouvion
established
in
paris
with
a
great
knowledge
of
art
and
some
considerable
skill
in
technique
steeped
in
classic
lore
contemptuous
of
dull
authority
and
full
of
youthful
enthusiasm
he
hailed
with
joy
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
but
by
the
end
of
1792
the
young
painter
was
too
keen
a
student
of
men
and
matters
not
to
perceive
the
danger
which
menaced
the
republic
and
like
all
other
thinking
men
was
lost
in
astonishment
not
to
say
at
the
imprudence
but
the
folly
of
the
convention
which
instead
of
seeking
to
diminish
the
number
of
its
enemies
seemed
resolved
to
augment
them
by
successive
insults
not
merely
against
all
kings
but
against
every
existing
government
in
spite
of
this
when
europe
threatened
france
laurent
gouvion
was
one
of
the
first
to
enlist
in
the
volunteers
his
personality
and
former
training
at
once
made
themselves
felt
within
a
month
of
enlisting
he
was
elected
captain
in
which
grade
he
joined
the
army
of
the
rhine
under
general
custine
on
reaching
the
front
the
volunteer
captain
soon
found
scope
for
his
pencil
in
an
army
thoroughly
disorganised
a
good
draughtsman
with
an
eye
for
country
was
no
despicable
asset
gouvion
was
attached
to
the
topographical
department
of
the
staff
he
added
his
mothers
namest
cyrto
his
surname
because
of
the
constant
confusion
arising
owing
to
the
number
of
gouvions
employed
with
the
army
after
a
years
hard
work
on
the
staff
during
which
he
acquired
a
thorough
grasp
of
the
art
of
manoeuvring
according
to
the
terrain
and
a
good
working
knowledge
of
the
machinery
of
an
army
st
cyr
was
promoted
on
june
5
1794
general
of
brigade
and
six
days
later
general
of
division
his
promotion
was
not
unmerited
for
it
was
his
complete
mastery
of
mountain
warfare
which
had
contributed
more
than
anything
else
to
the
success
of
the
division
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
to
which
he
had
been
attached
the
soldiers
had
long
recognised
the
fact
and
when
they
heard
the
guns
booming
through
the
defiles
of
the
vosges
they
used
to
call
one
to
the
other
there
is
st
cyr
playing
chess
like
bernadotte
at
first
he
refused
this
rapid
promotion
he
feared
it
might
lead
to
the
scaffold
for
death
was
then
the
reward
of
failure
and
besides
this
the
gouvions
were
classed
among
the
cidevant
nobles
as
a
commander
the
new
general
speedily
proved
that
much
as
he
admired
liberty
in
the
abstract
he
would
have
nothing
but
obedience
from
his
men
tall
of
stature
more
like
a
professor
than
a
soldier
through
all
his
career
wearing
the
plain
blue
overcoat
without
uniform
or
epaulettes
which
were
affected
by
the
generals
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
st
cyr
soon
became
one
of
the
best
known
generals
of
republican
france
as
one
of
his
most
bitter
enemies
wrote
of
him
it
was
impossible
to
find
a
calmer
man
the
greatest
dangers
disappointments
successes
defeats
were
alike
unable
to
move
him
in
the
presence
of
every
sort
of
contingency
he
was
like
ice
it
may
be
easily
understood
of
what
advantage
such
a
character
backed
by
a
taste
for
study
and
meditation
was
to
a
general
officer
in
the
army
of
the
rhine
desaix
and
st
cyr
were
regarded
as
the
persons
whose
examples
should
be
followed
the
austerity
of
their
manner
of
life
their
sincere
patriotism
and
laborious
perseverance
left
an
indelible
mark
on
all
with
whom
they
came
in
contact
but
though
they
had
much
in
common
they
were
really
very
dissimilar
for
desaix
was
intoxicated
with
the
love
of
glory
full
of
burning
enthusiasm
sympathetic
to
an
extraordinary
degree
exceedingly
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
the
moment
while
st
cyr
loved
duty
as
the
rule
of
his
life
modelled
his
action
by
the
strict
laws
of
calculation
was
absolutely
impervious
to
outside
influence
and
never
knew
what
it
was
to
doubt
his
own
powers
but
with
all
his
great
gifts
he
had
many
faults
he
was
exceedingly
jealous
and
without
knowing
it
he
allowed
his
own
interests
to
affect
his
calculations
consequently
very
early
in
his
career
his
fellowgenerals
hated
to
have
to
work
in
cooperation
with
him
and
he
got
the
name
of
being
a
bad
bedfellow
further
excellent
as
he
was
as
a
strategist
and
tactician
the
details
of
administration
bored
him
he
never
held
a
review
never
visited
hospitals
and
left
the
threads
of
administration
in
the
hands
of
his
subordinates
consequently
much
as
his
troops
trusted
him
in
the
field
they
disliked
him
in
quarters
because
while
his
discipline
was
most
severe
he
did
nothing
to
provide
for
their
needs
or
amusements

shared
the

of

of
the

serving
as

under

and
moreau
the
battle
of

in
1796
was
his
personal
triumph
with
one
single
corps
he
defeated
threefourths
of

whole
of

and
drove
it
in

with
a

of
five
thousand
prisoners

victory
and
numerous
mentions
in

on
being
introduced
to
the

after
the

of

he
was
actually
asked
in
which
army
have
you
served
an
explanation
was
necessary
whereupon
the
director
finding
that
the
general
understood
and
spoke
italian
sent
him
off
at
once
to
take
command
of
the
army
of
rome
on
march
26
1798
he
arrived
there
and
commenced
his
first
independent
command
his
task
was
a
difficult
one
the
officers
of
the
army
had
risen
in
revolt
against
masséna
who
had
made
no
attempt
to
pay
them
or
their
troops
but
had
spent
his
time
in
amassing
a
fortune
for
himself
the
new
general
had
orders
to
arrest
certain
officers
and
restore
discipline
it
was
a
task
admirably
suited
to
his
talents
and
within
four
days
of
his
arrival
the
disaffected
were
arrested
and
the
mutiny
quelled
his
next
duty
according
to
the
command
of
the
directory
was
to
remove
the
pope
from
rome
by
a
queer
coincidence
the
officer
entrusted
to
escort
his
holiness
to
tuscany
was
a
certain
colonel
calvin
so
far
st
cyr
much
against
his
wish
had
carried
out
the
orders
of
the
directory
but
his
next
action
was
spontaneous
and
dictated
by
his
own
idea
of
justice
it
was
the
hour
of
spoliation
a
committee
appointed
by
the
directory
was
busy
in
transporting
to
france
all
the
masterpieces
of
italian
art
and
the
newlyappointed
consuls
of
the
roman
republic
were
likewise
fully
engaged
in
acts
of
vandalism
when
the
general
heard
that
the
magnificent
oblation
of
diamonds
belonging
to
the
doria
family
had
been
purloined
from
the
church
of
st
agnes
to
grace
the
necks
of
the
wives
of
the
bastard
consuls
he
at
once
ordered
the
ostensoir
to
be
returned
to
its
owners
the
consuls
appealed
to
the
directory
so
after
a
command
of
four
short
months
st
cyr
was
recalled
only
to
be
sent
at
once
to
resume
his
old
position
as
a
divisional
commander
in
the
army
of
the
rhine

from
there
in
june
1799
he
was
hurriedly
despatched
to
italy
to
aid
moreau
who
was
attempting
to
stem
the
victorious
advance
of
the
austrians
and
russians
he
arrived
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
hardfought
fight
of
novi
and
to
help
to
organise
a
stubborn
resistance
on
the
slopes
of
the
apennines
before
the
battle
of
novi
he
actually
had
a
glimpse
of
the
redoubtable
suvaroff
himself
the
russian
general
who
trusted
his
own
eyes
more
than
the
reports
of
his
scouts
one
day
rode
right
up
to
the
line
of
french
vedettes
clad
in
his
usual
fighting
kit
a
shirt
and
pair
of
breeches
and
after
a
hurried
reconnaissance
returned
to
his
camp
and
gave
his
celebrated
order
god
wishes
the
emperor
orders
suvaroff
commands
that
tomorrow
the
enemy
be
conquered
novi
added
lustre
to
st
cyrs
reputation
it
was
his
strenuous
resistance
on
the
right
flank
and
his
admirable
handling
of
the
rear
guard
which
prevented
the
victorious
allies
from
hurling
the
beaten
french
through
the
passes
into
the
sea
but
novi
was
an
easy
task
compared
to
what
was
to
follow
the
passes
of
the
apennines
had
to
be
held
and
genoa
covered
with
a
handful
of
men
dispirited
by
defeat
and
half
mutinous
from
want
of
necessary
food
it
was
a
rabble
not
an
army
there
was
no
commissariat
no
pay
chest
no
store
of
clothing
meanwhile
genoa
lay
smouldering
in
rebellion
at
his
rear
the
task
suited
the
man
by
a
series
of
clever
feints
and
manoeuvres
in
the
valley
of
the
bormida
he
outwitted
the
enemy
and
gradually
restored
the
morale
of
his
troops
and
was
able
to
hurry
back
to
genoa
with
three
battalions
at
the
psychological
moment
when
mutiny
and
rebellion
were
showing
their
head
with
absolute
calmness
he
told
the
civic
authorities
to
prepare
quarters
for
eight
thousand
troops
of
which
the
few
with
him
were
the
advance
guard
the
authorities
staggered
by
his
sudden
appearance
never
doubted
the
arrival
of
this
fabulous
force
and
subsequently
st
cyr
was
able
to
occupy
all
the
strongholds
in
the
town
with
the
handful
of
troops
he
had
with
him
and
then
at
his
leisure
to
arrest
the
ringleaders
of
the
rebellion
meanwhile
the
judicious
establishment
of
free
soup
kitchens
in
the
streets
alleviated
the
necessities
of
the
mob
scarcely
was
genoa
pacified
when
the
general
was
confronted
by
a
much
more
serious
event
famine
had
driven
the
soldiers
to
mutiny
and
even
the
very
outposts
withdrew
from
contact
with
the
enemy
and
announced
their
intention
of
returning
to
france
it
was
only
by
raising
a
forced
loan
from
the
ligurian
government
and
delivering
a
most
touching
appeal
to
their
patriotism
that
he
was
able
to
persuade
the
mutineers
to
return
to
their
duty
telling
them
that
if
they
left
the
colours
he
intended
with
the
generals
officers
and
noncommissioned
officers
to
hold
the
positions
occupied
by
the
army
further
to
encourage
them
he
began
a
series
of
small
engagements
which
restored
their
morale
and
led
up
to
the
battle
of
albano
where
he
inflicted
so
severe
a
defeat
on
the
austrians
that
genoa
was
for
a
considerable
time
relieved
from
all
danger
the
first
consul
on
hearing
of
the
victory
of
albano
at
once
sent
st
cyr
a
sword
of
honour
a
damascus
blade
in
a
richly
engraved
sheath
with
the
pommel
encrusted
with
diamonds
which
had
originally
been
intended
for
the
sultan

but
though
thus
rewarded
by
receiving
the
first
sword
of
honour
ever
given
by
the
first
consul
he
was
never
a
persona
grata
with
napoleon
accordingly
at
the
beginning
of
1800
he
was
withdrawn
from
the
army
of
italy
and
sent
as
lieutenant
to
moreau
who
was
to
operate
in
the
valley
of
the
danube
while
bonaparte
reserved
the
theatre
of
italy
for
himself
it
was
most
unfortunate
for
st
cyr
that
he
was
supposed
to
belong
to
the
moreau
faction
for
day
by
day
the
struggle
between
that
general
and
the
first
consul
became
more
bitter
moreau
took
no
trouble
to
conceal
his
dislike
of
bonaparte
and
on
hearing
a
rumour
that
the
first
consul
intended
to
take
command
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
and
install
him
as
second
in
command
he
lost
his
temper
and
told
his
staff
at
dinner
that
he
did
not
want
a
little
tin
louis
xiv
with
his
army
and
that
if
the
first
consul
came
he
would
go
meanwhile
great
friction
arose
between
the
general
and
his
new
commanderinchief
st
cyr
proud
of
his
late
achievements
severely
criticised
the
plans
and
organisation
of
his
chief
who
was
extremely
indignant
at
the
idea
that
anybody
should
doubt
his
ability
to
manage
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
men
and
at
the
same
time
to
command
in
person
the
reserve
corps
of
twentyfive
thousand
so
moreau
belittled
st
cyrs
achievements
st
cyr
at
dengen
mosskirch
and
biberach
showed
his
accustomed
skill
as
a
tactician
but
failed
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
columns
on
his
right
and
left
and
increased
his
reputation
as
a
jealous
fighter
the
second
battle
of
biberach
was
a
masterpiece
of
audacity
and
to
his
dying
day
the
general
when
recalling
his
success
always
maintained
on
that
day
i
was
a
man
during
the
operations
round
ulm
relations
became
still
more
strained
and
st
cyr
was
glad
to
seize
the
excuse
of
a
wound
to
demand
his
return
to
france
the
first
consul
took
the
line
which
he
always
pursued
with
those
whom
he
disliked
but
feared
he
rewarded
st
cyr
by
making
him
a
councillor
of
state
and
at
the
same
time
he
got
him
out
of
the
way
by
sending
him
on
a
diplomatic
mission
to
spain
the
general
remained
at
madrid
till
august
1802
and
then
after
a
short
period
of
leave
at
paris
he
was
despatched
in
1803
to
command
the
army
at
faenza
which
was
to
occupy
the
kingdom
of
naples
after
the
rupture
of
the
treaty
of
amiens
during
the
two
years
spent
in
command
of
the
army
of
occupation
he
had
many
opportunities
of
showing
his
patience
and
diplomatic
skill
the
court
of
naples
had
to
be
treated
with
all
honour
but
watched
with
the
greatest
care
every
effort
had
to
be
made
to
maintain
outwardly
an
appearance
of
great
cordiality
while
napoleons
demands
had
to
be
insisted
on
to
the
letter
the
situation
was
further
complicated
by
the
continued
interference
of
murat
who
commanded
the
army
of
italy
and
who
desired
to
have
the
army
of
naples
under
his
control
the
strictest
discipline
had
to
be
maintained
among
the
troops
to
prevent
the
neapolitans
having
any
handle
to
use
against
the
army
of
occupation
so
successfully
did
st
cyr
keep
his
troops
in
hand
that
the
neapolitan
minister
wrote
in
his
next
despatch
to
the
queen
madame
we
can
make
nothing
of
that
point
these
men
are
not
soldiers
they
are
monks
in
spite
of
many
an
anxious
moment
these
two
years
in
naples
were
pleasant
years
for
the
general
who
delighted
in
the
congenial
society
of
the
many
men
of
letters
who
were
attached
to
his
army
for
as
paul
louis
corné
wrote
of
him
he
is
a
man
of
merit
a
learned
man
perhaps
the
most
learned
of
men
in
the
gentle
art
of
massacre
a
pleasant
man
in
private
life
a
great
friend
of
mine
but
there
was
one
great
disappointment
connected
with
this
neapolitan
command
for
in
1804
st
cyr
found
his
name
excluded
from
the
list
of
marshals
and
the
empty
title
of
colonelgeneral
of
the
cuirassiers
and
the
grand
cordon
of
the
legion
of
honour
in
no
way
made
amends
for
this
disappointment

the
outbreak
of
the
war
with
austria
in
the
autumn
of
1805
caused
napoleon
to
withdraw
the
army
of
occupation
from
naples
and
st
cyr
hastened
north
in
time
to
help
masséna
drive
the
austrians
out
of
styria
and
carinthia
he
greatly
distinguished
himself
at
castel
franco
where
with
a
smaller
force
he
captured
the
whole
of
a
column
of
the
enemy
under
the
prince
de
rohan
a
month
later
he
was
sent
back
in
haste
with
thirty
thousand
men
to
reinvade
naples
which
napoleon
had
given
as
a
kingdom
to
his
brother
joseph
but
on
hearing
that
he
was
to
act
as
a
subordinate
to
masséna
he
threw
up
his
command
and
withdrew
to
paris
this
independent
conduct
increased
napoleons
dislike
for
him
and
he
was
peremptorily
ordered
to
return
to
naples
where
he
remained
till
august
1806

it
was
not
till
two
years
later
that
the
emperor
once
again
employed
st
cyr
on
active
service
but
the
task
he
then
called
upon
him
to
perform
was
one
that
would
make
any
general
who
was
anxious
about
his
reputation
hesitate
to
undertake
for
napoleon
sent
him
with
a
motley
force
of
some
fortyeight
thousand
swiss
italians
and
germans
to
restore
french
prestige
in
the
mountainous
country
of
catalonia
and
ended
his
orders
with
the
words
preserve
barcelona
for
me
if
it
is
lost
i
cannot
retake
it
with
eighty
thousand
men
in
barcelona
lay
the
french
general
duhesme
who
had
been
hustled
into
that
town
by
the
spanish
regulars
and
guerillas
after
the
news
of
the
great
french
disaster
at
baylen
it
was
absolutely
vital
to
the
french
to
relieve
duhesme
before
lack
of
provisions
caused
him
to
surrender
but
before
any
advance
could
be
made
it
was
necessary
to
seize
the
fortress
of
rosas
which
lay
on
the
flank
of
the
road
from
france
to
barcelona
this
post
st
cyr
successfully
took
by
assault
under
the
very
guns
of
lord
dundonalds
fleet
but
still
the
problem
of
relieving
barcelona
was
a
difficult
one
there
were
two
alternative
lines
of
advance
the
first
and
easier
lay
along
the
coast
but
was
exposed
to
the
guns
of
the
english
fleet
the
other
road
was
a
mere
track
through
the
mountains
and
was
accordingly
extremely
difficult
owing
to
the
excellent
opportunities
it
gave
to
the
guerillas
but
st
cyr
keeping
his
seventeen
thousand
men
well
in
hand
and
taking
every
precaution
against
ambushes
successfully
broke
through
the
lines
of
regulars
and
guerillas
relieved
barcelona
and
pushed
on
down
the
coast
towards
tarragona
his
further
advance
was
stopped
by
the
rapid
reorganisation
of
the
spanish
armies
in
catalonia
and
it
became
clear
that
until
gerona
which
commanded
the
mountain
road
to
france
was
taken
the
french
forces
in
the
south
would
always
be
in
danger
of
having
their
communications
cut
accordingly
the
emperor
ordered
him
to
return
to
assist
general
verdier
to
capture
this
important
town
gerona
had
at
one
time
been
a
fortress
but
it
was
now
simply
covered
with
a
feeble
rampart
but
the
courage
of
the
townspeople
and
their
patriotism
was
fired
by
the
example
of
saragossa
and
their
spirit
was
animated
by
their
governor
alvarez
whose
order
whoever
speaks
of
capitulation
or
defeat
shall
be
instantly
put
to
death
was
received
with
shouts
of
delight
owing
to
quarrels
between
st
cyr
and
verdier
to
the
stubbornness
of
the
defence
and
above
all
to
the
constant
success
of
the
spanish
general
blake
in
throwing
provisions
into
the
town
the
siege
which
commenced
by
sap
and
assault
gradually
drifted
into
a
mere
blockade
and
lasted
for
six
and
a
half
months
at
last
the
emperor
angry
at
the
constant
bickering
between
the
commanders
and
at
the
protracted
siege
superseded
st
cyr
by
marshal
augereau
however
it
did
not
suit
that
marshal
to
take
over
his
command
until
there
seemed
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success
and
accordingly
he
waited
at
perpignan
for
news
of
the
approaching
end
of
the
siege
at
last
st
cyr
in
disgust
threw
up
his
command
without
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
augereau
the
emperor
marked
this
act
of
insubordination
by
sending
him
under
arrest
to
his
country
estate
and
depriving
him
of
all
his
appointments
accordingly
one
of
the
few
french
generals
who
never
sustained
a
defeat
in
spain
passed
the
next
two
years
of
his
life
in
disgrace
without
employment
while
day
by
day
the
french
arms
were
suffering
reverses
in
the
peninsula

it
was
not
till
1812
that
the
emperor
recalled
st
cyr
to
active
employment
and
gazetted
him
to
the
command
of
the
sixth
corps
which
together
with
the
second
corps
under
the
command
of
marshal
oudinot
was
employed
on
the
line
of
the
dwina
to
cover
the
communications
of
the
forces
advancing
on
moscow
the
campaign
in
russia
showed
the
general
at
his
best
and
at
his
worst
in
the
operations
round
polotsk
his
great
tactical
ability
enabled
him
with
the
small
forces
under
his
command
to
foil
again
and
again
the
efforts
of
the
russian
commander
wittgenstein
but
owing
to
his
want
of
supervision
before
the
winter
arrived
the
sixth
corps
which
entered
russia
twentyfive
thousand
strong
had
been
reduced
to
two
thousand
six
hundred
bayonets
it
was
not
till
his
corps
had
almost
disappeared
that
he
bestirred
himself
and
compelled
his
subordinates
to
look
after
the
wellbeing
and
provisions
of
their
men
moreover
when
placed
under
the
command
of
marshal
oudinot
while
carrying
out
to
the
letter
all
orders
transmitted
to
him
he
invariably
refused
to
aid
him
with
his
advice
and
even
during
the
first
battle
of
polotsk
when
asked
his
opinion
he
merely
bowed
and
said
my
lord
marshal
as
though
he
would
say
as
they
have
made
you
a
marshal
you
must
know
more
about
the
matter
than
a
mere
general
like
me
get
out
of
it
as
best
you
can
but
as
soon
as
a
wound
caused
oudinot
to
retire
from
the
field
he
at
once
seized
the
reins
of
command
and
so
great
was
the
influence
and
confidence
that
he
inspired
that
in
a
few
hours
the
army
which
oudinot
had
left
scattered
and
depressed
with
its
back
to
a
river
was
advancing
victoriously
and
sweeping
all
before
it
but
good
soldier
as
he
was
when
left
in
supreme
command
he
unfortunately
would
not
act
in
cooperation
with
others
and
when
at
the
end
of
october
victor
with
twentyfive
thousand
troops
arrived
to
reinforce
him
he
seized
the
opportunity
of
a
wound
to
throw
up
his
command
and
return
to
france
as
one
of
his
critics
says
all
that
st
cyr
needed
to
be
a
consummate
commander
was
a
smaller
share
of
egotism
and
the
knowledge
to
attach
men
and
officers
to
him
by
attending
to
their
wants
still
napoleon
recognised
his
services
against
wittgenstein
by
at
last
making
him
a
marshal

an
attack
of
typhus
and
a
burst
bloodvessel
deprived
the
emperor
of
his
new
marshals
assistance
until
after
the
armistice
of
dresden
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
two
had
actually
come
into
close
contact
and
napoleon
quickly
saw
that
thrawn
and
jealous
as
st
cyr
undoubtedly
was
his
clearness
of
brain
made
his
advice
of
the
highest
importance
while
st
cyr
speedily
fell
under
the
charm
of
the
great
emperor
accordingly
all
through
the
campaign
napoleon
constantly
came
to
him
for
advice
which
was
never
withheld
remembering
also
his
great
reputation
as
a
master
of
mountain
warfare
the
emperor
entrusted
him
with
the
duty
of
holding
the
highland
passes
leading
by
pirna
on
to
dresden
while
he
himself
hurried
off
to
silesia
in
the
great
battle
round
dresden
the
marshals
twenty
thousand
raw
recruits
played
their
part
nobly
napoleon
to
cover
his
own
mistakes
laid
the
blame
of
vandammes
disaster
on
st
cyr
and
marmont
but
in
his
private
letter
to
the
marshal
he
placed
the
blame
on
vandamme
as
he
wrote
that
unhappy
vandamme
who
seems
to
have
killed
himself
had
not
a
sentinel
on
the
mountain
nor
a
reserve
anywhere
when
the
emperor
fell
back
on
leipzig
he
entrusted
the
defence
of
dresden
to
st
cyr
leaving
him
twentytwo
thousand
troops
and
provisions
for
eight
days
after
a
siege
of
a
month
the
marshal
was
compelled
for
lack
of
powder
to
surrender
with
the
honours
of
war
but
the
allies
after
the
evacuation
of
the
town
refused
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
surrender
and
retained
him
and
his
troops
as
prisoners
of
war
consequently
he
took
no
part
in
the
campaign
of
1814
during
the
hundred
days
he
remained
quietly
at
his
country
estate
but
on
the
second
restoration
he
was
called
upon
to
undertake
the
duties
of
minister
of
war
to
disband
the
old
army
and
to
organise
the
new
forces
of
france
his
tenure
of
office
was
short
as
he
refused
to
serve
a
ministry
which
proposed
to
cede
french
territory
to
the
enemy
in
may
1817
on
the
accession
of
a
liberal
ministry
he
once
again
took
office
and
during
this
period
he
laid
the
foundation
of
the
general
staff
of
the
army
but
in
november
1819
he
resigned
and
lived
in
retirement
till
he
died
at
hyères
on
march
17
1830

during
his
hours
of
leisure
the
marshal
wrote
his
memoirs
which
he
intended
to
aid
the
future
historian
of
the
french
wars
these
memoirs
show
how
clear
and
cutting
his
judgments
were
both
of
men
and
matters
and
his
criticisms
throw
many
useful
lights
on
napoleons
character
and
his
methods
of
warfare
while
they
also
to
a
great
extent
reveal
his
own
character
no
one
who
reads
them
can
doubt
that
st
cyr
was
a
great
strategist
while
his
powers
as
a
tactician
are
proved
by
his
neverfailing
success
on
the
field
of
battle
but
in
spite
of
these
talents
the
marshals
actual
record
as
a
soldier
is
spoiled
by
his
defects
of
character
a
great
believer
in
living
by
rule
he
had
two
maxims
which
he
ever
clung
to
first
that
in
war
acts
of
kindness
are
too
often
harmful
second
the
old
adage
of
machiavelli
that
a
victory
destroys
the
effect
of
the
worst
operation
and
that
the
man
who
knows
how
to
give
battle
can
be
pardoned
every
fault
that
he
may
have
before
committed
in
his
military
career
it
is
to
these
two
maxims
that
we
must
attribute
the
want
of
supervision
he
showed
over
his
troops
and
his
absolute
lack
of
cordiality
towards
his
fellow
marshals
and
generals
which
gave
him
the
nickname
of
the
bad
bedfellow
for
that
he
did
not
lack
the
talents
of
an
organiser
is
shown
by
the
way
when
roused
he
provided
for
his
troops
in
russia
and
also
by
the
success
of
his
efforts
when
minister
of
war
but
of
all
his
gifts
undoubtedly
the
most
useful
was
his
absolute
coolness
no
matter
how
badly
the
fight
went
no
matter
if
he
were
run
away
with
in
his
carriage
and
carried
straight
through
a
brigade
of
the
enemys
horse
he
never
was
ruffled
never
lost
his
clear
grip
on
the
situation
his
bitter
enemy
macdonald
well
summed
up
his
character
in
answer
to
louis
xviiis
questions
as
to
whether
he
was
lazy
i
am
not
aware
of
it
said
the
duke
of
tarentum
he
is
a
man
of
great
military
capacity
firm
honest
but
jealous
of
other
peoples
merit
in
the
army
he
is
regarded
as
what
is
called
a
bad
bedfellow
in
the
coldest
manner
possible
he
allowed
his
neighbours
to
be
beaten
without
attempting
to
assist
them
and
then
criticised
them
afterwards
but
this
opinion
not
uncommon
among
soldiers
is
perhaps
exaggerated
and
he
is
admitted
to
have
calmness
and
great
capabilities

bon
adrien
jeannot
de
moncey
marshal
duke
of
conegliano


the
glamour
of
war
appeals
strongly
to
most
men
to
some
it
calls
with
irresistible
demand
such
an
one
was
the
duke
of
conegliano
born
on
july
31
1754
at
palise
a
little
village
of
besançon
the
son
of
a
welltodo
lawyer
bon
adrien
jeannot
loathed
scholarship
and
loved
adventure
when
but
fifteen
years
old
the
future
marshal
ran
away
from
school
and
enlisted
in
the
conti
regiment
of
infantry
after
six
months
service
he
reluctantly
agreed
to
the
purchase
of
his
discharge
by
his
father
but
very
soon
ran
away
again
to
enlist
in
the
regiment
of
champagne
he
served
with
this
regiment
till
1773
when
finding
that
his
hopes
of
gaining
a
commission
were
disappointed
he
once
again
bought
himself
out
a
few
months
however
spent
in
the
study
of
the
law
only
served
to
increase
his
hatred
of
a
sedentary
life
and
to
kindle
once
more
his
old
ambition
and
he
again
enlisted
as
a
private
this
time
in
the
gendarmerie
but
now
fortune
was
more
kind
and
after
four
years
service
he
achieved
his
desire
and
was
gazetted
in
1779
as
sublieutenant
in
the
dragoons
of
nassau
siegen
it
was
not
however
till
april
1791
that
he
gained
his
captaincy
which
had
cost
him
twentythree
years
hard
service
but
now
promotion
came
rapidly
and
in
three
years
time
he
rose
to
the
rank
of
general
of
division

in
1793
monceys
regiment
of
dragoons
formed
part
of
the
army
of
the
western
pyrenees
in
the
first
engagement
with
the
enemy
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
distinguish
himself
the
spanish
commanderinchief
bonaventura
casa
led
a
charge
of
horse
against
the
illdisciplined
recruits
and
volunteers
who
formed
the
mass
of
the
french
army
covering
st
jean
pied
de
porte
the
miserable
french
infantry
broke
with
cries
of
we
are
betrayed
and
it
was
moncey
who
rallying
a
few
brave
men
stopped
the
charge
of
the
enemys
horse
energetic
clearwitted
and
selfconfident
he
soon
became
a
man
of
mark
in
february
1794
he
was
promoted
general
of
brigade
and
six
months
later
general
of
division
in
which
capacity
in
august
of
that
year
he
was
mainly
instrumental
in
forcing
the
lines
of
fontarabia
on
the
proposition
of
barrère
he
was
a
few
days
later
appointed
by
the
convention
commanderinchief
of
the
army
of
the
western
pyrenees
in
october
he
fully
justified
his
selection
by
forcing
the
famous
pass
of
roncesvalles
so
intimately
connected
with
the
names
of
charlemagne
and
the
black
prince
this
action
which
made
good
a
footing
in
spain
was
extremely
brilliant
the
position
strong
by
nature
had
been
made
almost
impregnable
by
months
of
hard
labour
moreover
the
french
troops
were
badly
handicapped
by
the
difficulty
of
getting
food
but
by
now
they
were
very
different
from
the
illtrained
levies
of
1793
the
turning
column
which
had
four
days
hard
mountain
climbing
and
fighting
on
three
biscuits
per
man
found
nothing
to
eat
when
the
pass
was
forced
save
a
little
flour
for
the
spanish
had
burnt
their
magazines
in
spite
of
this
there
was
no
grumbling
and
the
men
as
their
general
reported
pressed
on
with
cries
of
vive
la
république
moncey
like
napoleon
knew
how
to
use
the
great
driving
force
of
hunger
he
thoroughly
deserved
the
thanks
which
he
received
from
the
convention
and
he
fully
earned
them
again
when
early
in
1795
he
drove
the
spanish
army
in
flight
across
the
ebro
for
it
was
his
magnificent
forward
movement
which
forced
spain
to
accede
to
the
treaty
of
basle

from
spain
the
general
was
transferred
to
the
army
of
the
côtes
de
brest
a
year
later
he
was
posted
to
the
command
of
the
eleventh
military
division
at
bayonne
and
he
was
still
there
when
in
october
1799
bonaparte
returned
from
egypt
and
overthrew
the
directory
no
politician
it
mattered
little
to
moncey
who
governed
france
as
long
as
the
honour
of
the
country
was
maintained
and
he
saw
active
service
accordingly
he
gladly
accepted
from
the
new
government
the
position
of
lieutenant
to
moreau
the
commanderinchief
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
but
he
did
not
serve
long
under
his
new
chief
being
detached
in
may
at
the
head
of
sixteen
thousand
to
cross
the
alps
by
the
st
gothard
pass
as
part
of
the
great
stroke
aimed
at
the
austrian
lines
of
communication
in
italy
his
corps
formed
a
flank
guard
to
the
main
army
of
the
reserve
which
crossed
the
st
bernard
under
napoleon
himself
in
the
operations
which
succeeded
the
battle
of
marengo
the
first
consul
made
full
use
of
monceys
great
experience
in
mountain
warfare
and
sent
him
to
the
valtelline
to
join
hands
with
macdonald
who
was
crossing
the
alps
by
the
splügen
pass
thereafter
his
division
formed
the
left
wing
of
the
french
army
under
brune
after
a
brilliant
series
of
skirmishes
in
the
mountains
moncey
drove
the
flying
enemy
into
trent
but
he
was
robbed
of
complete
victory
by
the
austrian
general
laudon
who
sent
a
message
to
say
that
brune
and
bellegarde
had
made
an
armistice
unfortunately
for
the
french
their
general
the
soul
of
honour
suspected
no
deceit
and
thus
the
austrians
were
saved
from
annihilation
or
absolute
surrender

after
the
peace
of
lunéville
general
moncey
was
appointed
inspectorgeneral
of
gendarmerie
and
on
napoleons
elevation
to
the
throne
was
created
in
1804
marshal
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
in
1808
duke
of
conegliano
moncey
invariably
spoke
his
mind
and
for
this
reason
was
no
favourite
with
the
emperor
further
in
comparison
with
his
fellow
marshals
he
was
an
old
man
so
from
1800
to
1808
he
was
not
employed
on
active
service
but
on
the
invasion
of
spain
napoleon
determined
to
make
use
of
the
duke
of
coneglianos
knowledge
of
that
country
and
ordered
him
to
proceed
there
with
the
army
of
observation
of
the
ocean
which
he
was
then
commanding
at
boulogne
this
army
became
the
third
corps
of
the
newly
formed
army
of
spain
it
was
composed
almost
entirely
of
recruits
and
when
murat
marched
into
madrid
at
the
head
of
the
third
corps
the
poor
physique
of
these
weak
and
weedy
privates
had
a
very
bad
effect
on
the
situation
for
the
spaniards
thought
they
could
easily
defeat
such
troops
from
madrid
the
marshal
was
sent
to
capture
valencia
which
had
broken
out
into
revolt
against
the
french
though
old
the
duke
of
conegliano
was
still
active
and
vigorous
after
a
months
continuous
fighting
across
mountain
passes
and
rivers
he
reached
valencia
but
he
found
the
town
in
a
state
of
defence
as
napoleon
said
on
hearing
of
his
check
a
city
of
eighty
thousand
inhabitants
barricaded
streets
and
artillery
entrenched
at
the
gates
cannot
be
taken
by
the
collar
accordingly
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
retreat
and
this
the
marshal
did
in
such
a
masterly
manner
that
the
failure
of
his
expedition
produced
but
little
bad
effect
on
the
french
cause
when
after
baylen
joseph
held
his
council
of
war
at
madrid
moncey
alone
stood
out
for
the
bold
course
of
cutting
communication
with
france
and
concentrating
around
the
capital
but
he
was
overruled
and
the
french
fell
back
on
the
line
of
the
ebro

as
soon
as
napoleon
arrived
in
spain
he
vented
his
anger
indiscriminately
on
all
those
marshals
who
had
served
under
joseph
but
his
greatest
displeasure
fell
on
moncey
for
the
duke
of
conegliano
did
not
believe
that
spain
could
be
gained
by
hanging
all
those
who
resisted
and
had
actually
received
the
thanks
of
the
junta
of
oviedo
who
considered
him
a
just
and
honourable
man
and
published
a
manifesto
saying
we
know
this
illustrious
general
detests
the
conduct
of
his
companions
accordingly
in
the
eyes
of
the
emperor
he
had
been
guilty
of
bungling
and
slackness
if
not
of
something
worse
and
he
was
therefore
subjected
to
the
cruel
affront
of
being
placed
under
the
orders
of
lannes
a
junior
marshal
though
much
annoyed
as
a
soldier
he
could
only
obey
and
the
emperors
decision
was
to
some
extent
justified
as
lannes
won
the
battle
of
tudela
with
the
same
troops
which
moncey
had
not
dared
to
lead
against
the
enemy
three
months
later
the
marshal
was
once
again
superseded
by
lannes
and
this
time
recalled
and
sent
to
france
the
ostensible
reason
for
this
was
that
in
the
emperors
opinion
he
had
not
pressed
the
siege
of
saragossa
with
a
desire
to
avoid
bloodshed
he
had
tried
to
induce
the
spaniards
to
capitulate
by
entering
into
negotiations
instead
of
pushing
on
his
siege
batteries
but
his
real
offence
was
that
he
had
not
concealed
his
dislike
of
the
seizure
of
spain

in
1812
his
disgrace
was
deepened
for
he
expressed
with
equal
frankness
his
hatred
of
the
russian
campaign
though
never
again
employed
at
the
front
the
emperor
made
use
of
him
in
1809
in
holland
and
in
1812
and
1813
he
led
the
army
of
reserve
while
in
1814
he
was
appointed
majorgeneral
of
the
national
guard
of
paris
and
made
responsible
for
the
defence
of
the
capital
in
the
last
dark
days
before
the
city
capitulated
moncey
with
six
thousand
citizen
soldiers
fought
bravely
outside
the
clichy
gate

on
the
restoration
the
marshal
became
a
minister
of
state
and
a
member
of
the
new
chamber
of
peers
and
was
confirmed
in
his
old
appointment
of
inspector
of
gendarmerie
but
on
the
return
of
napoleon
he
forgot
the
wrongs
the
emperor
had
done
him
he
thought
only
of
the
glory
napoleon
had
once
won
for
france
so
he
swore
allegiance
to
the
imperial
government
and
was
created
a
peer
but
on
account
of
his
age
the
emperor
gave
him
no
military
command
to
punish
him
for
his
desertion
louis
xviii
on
the
second
restoration
appointed
him
president
of
the
council
of
war
for
the
trial
of
ney
but
the
duke
of
conegliano
wrote
to
the
king
boldly
refusing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
trial
of
the
hero
of
moskowa
so
angry
was
the
king
at
his
courageous
act
that
he
stripped
the
veteran
of
his
marshalate
and
the
title
of
duke
and
sent
him
to
prison
for
three
months
in
the
castle
of
ham
the
same
prison
which
was
later
to
receive
the
future
napoleon
iii
but
time
brought
forgiveness
in
1819
the
marshal
was
restored
to
his
honours
and
in
1823
was
actually
once
again
employed
on
active
service
it
must
have
brought
strange
memories
of
the
past
to
the
veteran
who
had
been
thought
too
old
to
fight
at
waterloo
again
to
see
service
in
spain
where
he
had
won
his
laurels
in
1794
and
had
found
naught
but
disgrace
in
1808
so
in
his
seventieth
year
he
made
his
last
campaign
not
in
command
of
a
republican
or
imperial
army
but
as
a
corps
commander
in
the
royal
army
under
the
duc
dangoulême
this
time
however
there
was
but
little
call
on
his
courage
and
ability
for
the
campaign
brought
no
fighting
and
was
merely
a
military
promenade
on
the
fall
of
the
bourbon
dynasty
the
marshal
took
no
active
part
in
affairs
but
as
governor
of
the
invalides
in
december
1833
he
had
the
honour
to
receive
the
remains
of
napoleon
when
they
were
translated
to
france
and
on
his
death
nine
years
later
in
1842
at
his
special
request
he
was
buried
in
the
aisle
of
the
brave
close
to
the
tomb
of
the
great
emperor




xiv

jean
baptiste
jourdan
marshal


among
the
recruits
who
enlisted
in
the
auxerrois
regiment
in
1778
was
the
son
of
the
local
doctor
of
limoges
jean
baptiste
jourdan
but
sixteen
years
old
having
been
born
on
april
29
1762
jean
baptiste
was
attracted
to
the
service
by
the
desire
to
see
america
and
to
aid
in
the
good
cause
against
perfide
albion
returning
to
france
in
1784
with
all
hopes
of
gaining
a
commission
dashed
to
the
ground
by
ségurs
ordinance
which
excluded
from
commissioned
rank
all
but
those
of
noble
birth
jourdan
took
his
discharge
the
exsergeant
married
a
marchande
de
modes
and
set
up
a
small
drapery
shop
but
so
humble
was
this
venture
that
the
future
marshal
had
to
carry
his
stock
in
a
valise
on
his
back
and
trudge
from
fair
to
fair
to
peddle
his
wares
as
he
went
from
village
to
village
he
retold
his
adventures
and
fired
his
listeners
with
the
account
of
the
glorious
freedom
of
the
new
world
comparing
it
with
the
miserable
restrictions
which
had
driven
from
the
army
himself
and
many
another
fine
soldier
when
in
the
autumn
of
1791
there
came
the
call
for
volunteers
jean
baptiste
gladly
left
his
counter
and
enlisted
in
the
battalion
of
the
upper
vienne
his
experience
and
ability
soon
marked
him
out
for
command
and
he
was
chosen
by
his
comrades
as
lieutenantcolonel
the
opportunity
he
had
long
dreamed
of
had
at
last
arrived
and
he
made
the
most
of
it
methodical
and
industrious
with
the
lessons
of
handling
and
equipping
irregulars
which
he
had
had
in
america
he
made
his
battalion
a
pattern
for
the
others
and
was
complimented
by
lafayette
on
the
admirable
condition
of
his
command
serving
under
dumouriez
in
the
invasion
of
belgium
he
was
present
at
jemappes
and
there
proved
that
in
addition
to
powers
of
organisation
he
possessed
the
capacity
for
leading
in
the
field
promotion
came
speedily
when
the
guillotine
cleared
the
way
in
the
higher
ranks
by
removing
the
incompetent
and
unfortunate

by
may
1793
he
had
gained
the
grade
of
general
of
brigade
two
months
later
he
became
general
of
division
his
first
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
in
high
command
came
six
weeks
later
when
he
was
entrusted
by
houchard
with
the
command
of
the
advance
guard
in
the
operations
which
ended
in
driving
the
english
from
the
siege
of
dunkirk
so
well
did
he
execute
his
orders
at
the
battle
of
handschötten
that
carnot
selected
him
to
succeed
his
commander
when
houchard
was
hurried
off
to
the
guillotine
for
failing
to
reap
the
full
fruits
of
victory
jourdan
was
fortunate
in
that
carnot
the
organiser
of
victory
was
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
the
french
arms
and
not
the
despicable
bouchotte
carnot
had
grasped
the
fact
that
if
you
are
to
defeat
your
enemy
you
must
bring
superior
moral
and
physical
force
against
him
at
the
decisive
spot
thanks
therefore
to
him
jourdan
was
able
to
mass
superior
weight
and
at
maubeuge
hurl
himself
on
the
scattered
forces
of
the
enemy
who
were
covering
the
siege
of
valenciennes
but
the
victory
of
maubeuge
nearly
cost
him
his
head
as
that
of
handschötten
had
done
for
his
predecessor
the
committee
of
public
safety
with
that
incompetent
rashness
which
those
who
know
least
of
war
most
readily
believe
to
be
military
wisdom
ordered
him
to
pursue
the
enemy
and
conquer
belgium
it
was
in
vain
that
he
pointed
out
the
strength
of
the
allies
his
want
of
transport
and
stores
and
the
difficulty
of
undertaking
a
winter
campaign
with
raw
troops
reason
was
of
no
avail
his
resignation
was
wrathfully
accepted
and
he
was
ordered
to
paris
to
give
an
account
of
his
actions
face
to
face
with
the
committee
the
general
renewed
his
arguments
explained
how
the
old
battalions
of
regulars
had
dwindled
down
to
some
two
hundred
muskets
apiece
how
the
new
levies
possessed
neither
arms
nor
clothing
how
some
battalions
were
armed
with
pikes
some
merely
with
cudgels
and
finished
by
offering
as
a
proof
of
his
zeal
for
the
republic
to
go
to
la
vendée
and
fight
against
the
rebels
the
truth
of
his
statement
and
his
obvious
disinterestedness
won
the
day
and
though
for
the
moment
he
was
refused
a
new
command
his
life
was
saved
moreover
the
committee
of
safety
profited
by
his
advice
and
during
the
winter
the
army
of
the
north
was
reclothed
and
equipped
thanks
partly
to
his
suggestion
the
battalions
of
the
line
were
brigaded
with
the
volunteers
and
this
reorganisation
produced
the
magnificent
regiments
which
napoleon
found
to
hand
when
he
commenced
his
career
in
italy

baptiste

after
a

by

tardieu

jourdans
time
of
inactivity
was
but
short
he
had
proved
his
worth
in
the
field
and
france
needed
every
capable
soldier
moreover
he
had
made
open
testimony
of
his
republicanism
in
the
jacobin
club
swearing
before
the
tribune
that
the
sword
which
he
wore
should
only
be
unsheathed
to
oppose
tyrants
and
defend
the
rights
of
the
people
so
in
march
1794
he
was
sent
to
take
command
of
a
new
army
which
carnot
had
been
raising
during
the
winter
by
june
this
new
force
of
one
hundred
thousand
known
to
history
as
the
famous
army
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
had
established
itself
on
the
meuse
and
taken
charleroi
coburg
the
commanderinchief
of
the
allies
anxious
about
his
communications
hurried
to
oppose
this
successful
advance
and
on
june
25th
was
fought
the
battle
of
fleurus
which
caused
the
allies
to
evacuate
france
ended
the
reign
of
terror
and
was
the
startingpoint
for
the
long
period
of
offensive
warfare
which
was
at
last
brought
to
an
end
twentyone
years
later
on
the
field
of
waterloo
at
fleurus
jourdan
proved
his
ability
as
a
tactician
and
the
victory
was
due
to
the
moral
courage
with
which
he
threw
his
last
reserve
into
the
fray
backed
by
the
army
of
the
north
under
pichegru
he
then
swept
over
belgium
and
by
the
autumn
the
republican
armies
had
crossed
the
rhine

during
the
next
year
jourdan
was
engaged
in
the
rhine
valley
but
in
1796
he
was
ordered
to
advance
through
the
black
forest
on
ratisbon
and
there
join
another
french
army
under
moreau
which
was
moving
down
the
right
bank
of
the
danube
against
this
defective
strategy
he
protested
in
vain
and
as
he
had
expected
was
driven
back
by
the
able
measures
of
the
austrian
general
the
archduke
charles
after
this
misfortune
he
was
placed
on
the
unemployed
list
and
for
some
time
had
to
find
an
outlet
for
his
energies
in
the
field
of
politics
entering
the
council
of
five
hundred
as
the
representative
of
the
upper
vienne
he
was
warmly
received
by
the
republican
party
and
voted
against
the
proposed
reestablishment
of
the
catholic
religion
and
supported
the
coup
détat
of
the
18th
fructidor
by
which
the
royalist
councillors
were
driven
into
exile
full
of
fiery
zeal
for
the
republic
a
rhetorical
speaker
ready
to
appeal
to
the
gallery
swearing
on
his
sabre
the
oath
of
fidelity
he
nevertheless
had
a
cool
head
for
business
and
it
was
at
his
suggestion
that
in
september
1798
the
celebrated
law
was
passed
whereby
conscription
became
the
sole
method
of
recruiting
for
the
army
jourdan
introduced
the
law
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
assuring
the
council
that
in
agreeing
to
it
they
had
decreed
the
power
of
the
republic
to
be
imperishable
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
forging
the
weapon
which
was
to
place
their
country
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
adventurer
who
had
the
courage
and
capacity
to
make
himself
dictator
in
1799
foreign
danger
once
again
caused
him
to
be
entrusted
with
a
military
command
and
once
again
he
was
opposed
by
his
old
adversary
the
archduke
charles
and
driven
back
in
retreat
across
the
rhine
thereon
the
directory
superseded
him
by
masséna
and
he
returned
to
the
council
of
five
hundred
and
in
september
proposed
his
memorable
resolution
that
the
country
is
in
danger
italy
under
the
yoke
the
barbarians
of
the
north
at
our
very
barriers
holland
invaded
the
fleet
treacherously
given
up
helvetia
ravaged
bands
of
royalists
indulging
in
every
excess
the
republicans
proscribed
under
the
name
of
terrorists
and
jacobins
such
were
the
outlines
of
his
picture
one
more
reverse
on
our
frontier
he
added
and
the
alarm
bell
of
royalty
will
ring
over
the
whole
surface
of
france
but
france
had
had
enough
of
the
terror
and
knew
that
she
could
evolve
her
safety
by
other
means
than
that
of
the
guillotine
six
weeks
later
bonaparte
returned
from
egypt

from
the
advent
of
the
consulate
a
blight
fell
over
jourdans
career
napoleon
could
never
forgive
him
for
the
obstinacy
with
which
he
had
opposed
him
on
the
18th
brumaire
true
in
1800
he
appointed
him
governor
of
piedmont
and
in
1804
created
him
marshal
he
could
not
withhold
the
bâton
from
the
general
who
had
in
1794
driven
the
enemy
from
the
sacred
soil
of
france
who
more
often
than
any
other
general
had
commanded
in
chief
the
armies
of
the
republic
and
who
in
spite
of
numerous
defeats
had
established
a
reputation
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
the
generals
of
republican
france
but
though
he
gave
him
his
bâton
napoleon
thought
but
little
of
his
military
ability
and
called
him
a
poor
general
for
in
his
eyes
success
and
success
alone
was
the
test
of
merit
and
he
could
see
nothing
in
a
general
who
from
his
capacity
for
emerging
with
credit
from
defeat
was
surnamed
the
anvil
but
it
was
not
this
which
caused
napoleon
to
snub
the
gallant
marshal
it
was
his
ardent
republicanism
and
wellknown
jacobin
sentiments
which
made
him
so
hateful
to
the
emperor
but
though
napoleon
treated
him
shamefully
and
did
all
he
could
to
cast
him
into
ill
repute
the
marshal
showed
he
had
a
soul
above
mere
personal
ambitions
and
served
france
faithfully
at
st
helena
the
fallen
emperor
confessed
i
certainly
used
that
man
very
ill
he
is
a
true
patriot
and
that
is
the
answer
to
many
things
urged
against
him
from
1805
to
1815
jourdans
life
was
full
of
mortification
when
the
war
broke
out
against
austria
in
1805
he
was
in
command
of
the
army
in
italy
but
was
at
once
superseded
under
the
plea
that
his
health
was
bad
and
that
he
did
not
know
the
theatre
of
war
like
masséna
however
cleverly
the
pill
was
gilded
the
marshal
knew
that
it
was
the
emperors
distrust
which
had
lost
him
the
command
but
though
napoleon
disliked
him
joseph
was
his
friend
and
in
1806
the
new
king
of
naples
applied
to
be
allowed
to
take
him
with
him
to
italy
as
his
majorgeneral
and
chief
of
the
staff
when
in
1808
joseph
exchanged
the
crown
of
naples
for
that
of
spain
the
marshal
accompanied
him
and
when
in
1809
napoleon
hurriedly
left
spain
to
return
to
paris
he
appointed
him
chief
of
the
staff
to
king
joseph
the
majorgenerals
task
was
a
difficult
one
he
had
no
executive
authority
his
duty
was
simply
to
give
advice
to
the
king
and
to
transmit
such
orders
as
he
received
but
unfortunately
neither
joseph
nor
he
had
the
power
to
enforce
orders
once
given
for
although
certain
french
corps
had
been
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
king
and
were
supposed
to
obey
his
orders
their
commanders
had
still
to
communicate
with
berthier
and
to
receive
through
him
the
decrees
of
the
emperor
hence
there
was
a
dual
authority
and
to
make
matters
worse
napoleon
did
not
attempt
to
veil
his
contempt
of
josephs
military
ability
at
the
same
time
he
cast
aspersions
on
jourdans
skill
and
showed
his
open
dislike
to
the
marshal
by
omitting
his
name
from
the
list
of
french
marshals
in
the
almanack
under
the
pretence
that
he
had
been
transferred
to
the
spanish
establishment
and
was
no
longer
a
frenchman
consequently
the
other
marshals
paid
but
little
attention
to
the
king
or
the
majorgeneral
at
the
battle
of
talavera
jourdans
advice
was
utterly
disregarded
and
his
orders
entirely
neglected
and
still
he
had
to
bear
the
blame
and
endure
the
whole
of
napoleons
wrath
in
despair
broken
down
in
health
he
applied
to
be
relieved
of
his
duties
and
returned
home
to
private
life
but
in
1812
when
the
emperor
was
summoning
his
vast
army
for
the
invasion
of
russia
being
short
of
officers
he
sent
the
marshal
back
to
his
old
post
in
spain
the
task
had
been
a
hard
one
in
1809
it
was
harder
still
in
1812
the
flower
of
the
french
troops
were
now
withdrawn
for
the
russian
campaign
the
authority
of
the
king
was
more
feeble
than
ever
and
years
of
warfare
had
transformed
the
english
army
into
a
perfect
fighting
machine
the
spaniards
were
now
past
masters
in
guerilla
warfare
while
the
iniquitous
scheme
of
making
war
support
war
had
subverted
discipline
and
broken
the
morale
of
the
french
army
with
admirable
lucidity
the
marshal
drew
up
a
memoir
showing
the
state
of
affairs
in
spain
and
pointing
out
what
was
at
fault
but
memoirs
written
for
joseph
could
not
alter
evils
which
flowed
directly
from
napoleons
having
broken
the
golden
canon
of
the
unity
of
command
with
three
practically
independent
commandersinchief
who
refused
to
acknowledge
the
controlling
authority
of
the
king
who
were
too
jealous
of
each
other
to
work
with
mutual
accord
disaster
was
bound
to
follow
the
temporary
cooperation
of
all
three
drove
the
english
back
on
portugal
at
the
end
of
1812
but
in
1813
the
disaster
in
russia
had
caused
the
emperor
to
make
further
heavy
drafts
on
the
force
in
spain
jourdan
could
only
advise
a
steady
retirement
towards
france
the
culminating
blow
at
vittoria
was
no
fault
of
his
struck
down
by
a
fever
the
day
before
the
action
he
was
unable
to
give
his
advice
at
the
critical
moment
so
joseph
had
to
fight
vittoria
without
the
assistance
of
the
chief
of
his
staff
and
with
subordinates
who
not
only
despised
but
disobeyed
him
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
it
was
no
wonder
that
defeat
easily
turned
into
rout
the
whole
of
the
french
baggage
was
captured
and
in
the
flight
the
marshal
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
his
bâton
which
was
picked
up
by
the
87th
regiment
and
sent
to
england

after
1813
jourdans
career
came
to
a
close
napoleon
heaped
reproaches
on
him
and
refused
him
further
employment
entirely
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
it
was
he
himself
who
was
responsible
for
the
spanish
disaster
and
that
the
marshal
had
done
all
that
was
possible
on
the
emperors
abdication
the
old
jacobin
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
king
louis
and
remained
true
to
his
allegiance
during
the
hundred
days
time
had
chastened
and
mellowed
his
fiery
republicanism
and
seeing
that
a
republic
was
impossible
he
preferred
the
chance
of
constitutional
liberty
under
a
monarchy
to
the
tyranny
of
the
empire
in
1817
as
a
reward
for
his
services
he
was
created
a
peer
of
france
but
though
he
accepted
the
restoration
in
preference
to
the
empire
all
his
sympathies
were
liberal
and
no
one
had
a
greater
dislike
for
the
reactionary
policy
of
charles
x
in
1830
he
gladly
accepted
the
new
liberal
constitution
of
louis
philippe
the
old
philip
égalité
of
the
days
of
jemappes
the
new
monarch
appointed
his
former
comrade
governor
of
the
hospital
of
the
invalides
and
there
among
his
old
fellowsoldiers
of
the
revolutionary
wars
the
marshal
breathed
his
last
on
november
23
1833
in
his
seventysecond
year

charles
pierre
françois
augereau
marshal
duke
of
castiglione


the
future
duke
of
castiglione
was
born
in
paris
on
november
11
1757
his
father
was
a
mason
by
trade
and
his
mother
a
native
of
munich
kept
a
furniture
shop
in
the
faubourg
saint
marceau
from
his
earliest
youth
pierre
françois
handsome
and
longlimbed
hotblooded
and
vain
thirsted
after
adventure
at
the
age
of
seventeen
on
his
mothers
death
he
enlisted
in
the
carabineers
a
keen
soldier
and
a
fine
horseman
he
soon
became
sergeant
and
within
a
few
years
gained
the
name
of
being
one
of
the
best
blades
in
the
army
but
in
upholding
this
reputation
sergeant
augereau
constantly
fell
into
disgrace
with
the
authorities
though
a
blusterer
by
nature
and
full
of
bravado
the
sergeant
was
certainly
no
coward
on
one
occasion
a
noted
professional
duellist
thought
that
he
could
intimidate
him
accordingly
he
swaggered
into
a
café
where
augereau
was
talking
to
some
friends
and
plunged
himself
down
on
the
table
at
which
the
sergeant
was
sitting
and
lolling
back
till
he
almost
leant
against
him
began
to
boast
how
on
the
previous
day
he
had
accounted
for
two
sergeants
of
the
garde
française
this
was
sufficient
insult
to
cause
a
challenge
but
augereau
preferred
to
let
the
challenge
come
from
his
adversary
and
accordingly
undoing
the
leather
belt
of
his
wouldbe
opponent
he
quietly
poured
the
whole
of
a
cup
of
scalding
coffee
down
the
inside
of
his
breeches
having
thus
taken
the
upper
hand
of
the
quarrel
he
so
completely
mastered
the
spirit
of
the
bully
that
he
had
little
difficulty
in
disposing
of
him
in
the
duel
which
followed
an
unfortunate
incident
cut
short
his
career
in
the
carabineers
one
day
a
young
officer
losing
his
temper
with
him
on
parade
threatened
to
strike
him
with
his
whip
thereon
augereau
in
fury
snatched
the
whip
from
the
officer
who
at
once
drew
his
sword
and
attacked
him
augereau
at
first
confined
himself
to
parrying
but
at
last
being
wounded
he
thrust
out
and
killed
his
opponent
the
colonel
well
aware
that
it
was
not
the
sergeants
fault
arranged
for
his
escape
across
the
frontier
after
wandering
about
constantinople
and
the
levant
augereau
passed
some
years
as
sergeant
in
the
russian
army
and
served
under
suvaroff
at
the
taking
of
ismailia
but
getting
tired
of
service
in
the
east
he
deserted
and
escaped
to
prussia
there
he
enlisted
and
owing
to
his
height
and
proficiency
in
drill
was
transferred
to
the
guards
his
captain
held
out
hopes
of
a
commission
but
these
were
dashed
for
when
he
was
brought
to
the
kings
notice
frederick
asked
who
he
was
a
frenchman
sire
was
the
reply
so
much
the
worse
answered
the
king
so
much
the
worse
if
he
had
been
a
swiss
or
a
german
we
might
have
done
something
for
him
augereau
on
hearing
this
determined
to
quit
the
prussian
service
desertion
was
the
only
way
of
escape
but
the
prussians
by
offering
heavy
rewards
for
recapture
had
made
desertion
almost
impossible
luckily
he
was
not
the
only
guardsman
dissatisfied
with
the
prussian
service
and
he
had
little
difficulty
in
getting
together
about
sixty
of
the
boldest
of
the
regiment
and
seizing
a
favourable
opportunity
he
marched
off
his
squad
with
their
arms
and
ammunition
and
beating
off
all
attacks
from
the
peasants
and
detachments
of
soldiers
who
tried
to
stop
them
he
safely
convoyed
his
comrades
across
the
frontier
to
saxony
after
this
escapade
augereau
settled
down
as
a
dancing
and
fencing
master
at
dresden
but
on
the
amnesty
at
the
birth
of
the
dauphin
he
returned
to
france
and
regained
his
rank
in
his
old
regiment
his
adventurous
life
and
his
natural
aspirations
soon
made
him
tire
of
always
holding
a
subordinate
position
and
in
1788
he
applied
to
be
sent
as
one
of
the
french
instructors
to
help
in
the
reorganisation
of
the
neapolitan
army
there
he
soon
gained
a
commission
in
1791
he
fell
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
greek
merchant
and
as
her
father
refused
to
listen
to
him
he
quietly
married
her
and
carried
her
off
by
ship
to
lisbon
in
portugal
his
freedom
of
speech
and
approval
of
the
changes
which
were
happening
in
france
caused
the
authorities
to
hand
him
over
to
the
inquisition
from
whence
he
was
rescued
by
a
french
skipper
and
conveyed
with
his
wife
to
havre

pierre
augereau
duke
of
castiglione
from
an
engraving
by
ruotte

augereau
returned
to
france
ready
to
absorb
the
most
republican
doctrines
his
banishment
after
killing
the
officer
had
always
seemed
unfair
his
long
subordination
and
the
harshness
of
military
discipline
had
rankled
in
his
soul
physically
he
knew
himself
superior
to
most
men
and
by
his
wits
he
had
found
himself
able
to
hold
his
own
and
make
his
way
in
nearly
every
country
in
europe
so
far
birth
had
seemed
to
be
the
only
barrier
which
cut
him
off
from
success
but
now
caste
was
hurled
aside
and
france
was
calling
for
talent
good
soldiers
were
scarce
augereau
saw
his
opportunity
and
used
it
to
the
full
a
few
months
spent
fighting
in
la
vendée
taught
him
that
renown
was
not
to
be
gained
in
civil
war
and
accordingly
he
got
himself
transferred
to
the
army
of
the
pyrenees
where
he
rose
in
six
months
from
simple
captain
to
general
of
division
from
the
pyrenees
he
was
transferred
with
his
division
to
italy
and
covered
himself
with
glory
at
loano
millesimo
and
lodi
but
it
was
his
conduct
at
castiglione
which
once
and
for
all
made
his
reputation
though
it
is
not
true
as
he
boasted
in
1814
after
deserting
the
emperor
that
it
was
only
his
invincible
firmness
which
caused
bonaparte
to
fight
instead
of
retreat
for
bonaparte
was
concentrating
to
fight
and
his
abandonment
of
the
siege
of
mantua
against
which
augereau
so
wildly
protested
was
but
part
of
the
preparation
for
victory
though
he
would
not
listen
to
augereaus
strategic
advice
he
had
enough
confidence
in
him
to
leave
the
first
attack
on
castiglione
entirely
in
his
hands
according
to
the
marshals
memoirs
bonaparte
was
afraid
of
attacking
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
and
go
away
he
said
and
who
will
command
if
you
go
asked
augereau
you
retorted
bonaparte
and
well
he
did
his
work
for
not
only
did
he
defeat
the
fifteen
thousand
austrians
at
castiglione
but
he
restored
the
fallen
confidence
of
his
soldiers
and
refreshed
the
morale
of
the
whole
army
napoleon
never
forgot
this
service
and
when
detractors
saw
fit
to
cast
their
venom
at
augereau
he
answered
let
us
not
forget
that
he
saved
us
at
castiglione
from
castiglione
onwards
the
soldiers
of
augereaus
division
would
do
anything
for
their
commander
it
was
not
only
that
they
respected
his
tactical
gifts
and
had
complete
confidence
in
him
in
the
hour
of
battle
but
they
loved
him
for
his
care
of
them
in
time
of
peace
a
stern
disciplinarian
with
a
touch
of
the
drill
sergeant
he
was
ever
ready
to
hear
their
complaints
and
never
spared
himself
in
looking
after
their
welfare
while
in
war
time
he
was
always
thinking
of
their
food
and
clothing
but
above
all
he
gave
them
booty
adventurer
as
he
was
by
nature
and
training
he
loved
the
spoils
of
war
himself
and
while
the
baggage
wagon
of
augereau
was
the
byword
in
the
army
he
saw
to
it
that
his
men
had
their
wagons
also
well
loaded
with
plunder
his
courage
was
a
thing
to
conjure
with
at
lodi
he
had
been
one
of
the
numerous
generals
who
rushed
the
bridge
but
at
arcola
alone
flag
in
hand
he
stood
on
the
bridge
and
hurled
taunts
and
encouragements
at
his
struggling
troops
and
for
three
continuous
days
exposed
himself
the
guiding
spirit
of
every
assault
and
forlorn
hope
while
adding
to
his
reputation
as
a
stern
and
courageous
fighter
a
clever
tactician
and
a
born
leader
of
men
augereaus
opinion
of
himself
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
he
was
in
no
way
surprised
when
after
leoben
bonaparte
entrusted
him
with
a
delicate
secret
mission
to
paris
in
his
own
opinion
no
better
agent
could
have
been
found
in
the
rôle
of
a
stern
unbending
republican
and
fiery
jacobin
bonaparte
told
him
he
would
represent
the
feeling
of
the
army
of
italy
and
help
to
bring
to
nothing
the
wiles
of
the
royalists
so
the
general
arrived
at
paris
full
of
his
mission
and
of
his
own
importance
to
the
delight
of
his
fatherthe
old
masonwho
saw
him
ride
into
the
city
covered
with
gold
lace
to
present
sixty
stands
of
captured
colours
to
the
directory
once
in
paris
the
fighting
generals
threats
against
the
clicheans
were
turned
into
deeds
though
he
protested
that
paris
has
nothing
to
fear
from
me
i
am
a
paris
boy
myself
on
september
4
1797
he
quietly
drew
a
cordon
of
troops
round
the
tuileries
where
the
councils
sat
and
arrested
and
banished
all
whose
political
opinions
opposed
his
own
relying
on
the
promises
of
barras
he
now
thought
that
he
would
become
a
director
in
place
of
either
carnot
or
barthélemy
who
had
been
deposed
but
he
soon
found
to
his
sorrow
that
he
was
not
the
great
politician
he
had
believed
himself
to
be
but
merely
the
dupe
of
bonaparte
and
others
who
had
allowed
him
to
clear
the
ground
for
them
and
to
incur
the
consequent
odium
his
immediate
reward
was
the
command
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
full
of
bitterness
he
arrived
at
his
new
headquarters
covered
with
gold
embroidery
even
down
to
his
short
boots
and
thought
to
debauch
his
soldiers
and
get
himself
accepted
as
dictator
by
telling
how
in
the
army
of
italy
everybody
had
a
pocketful
of
gold
but
the
directory
though
unable
to
curb
a
bonaparte
had
no
fears
of
the
fructidor
general
and
very
soon
deprived
him
of
his
command
and
sent
him
to
an
unimportant
post
at
perpignan
on
the
spanish
frontier

for
two
years
augereau
remained
at
perpignan
where
he
had
time
to
understand
the
causes
of
his
failure
though
completely
dominated
by
bonaparte
while
in
his
presence
he
had
not
the
guileless
heart
of
a
lefèbvre
and
he
began
to
perceive
how
the
wily
corsican
had
used
him
and
betrayed
him
accordingly
when
bonaparte
returned
from
egypt
he
read
his
design
of
becoming
dictator
and
true
to
his
jacobin
principles
at
first
resolved
to
fight
him
to
the
death
when
however
he
found
generals
officers
and
men
going
over
to
bonaparte
he
hastened
off
to
make
his
submission
saying
reproachfully
when
you
were
about
to
do
something
for
our
country
how
could
you
forget
your
own
little
augereau
but
though
he
made
his
submission
again
and
again
his
jacobin
principles
made
themselves
felt
forced
to
accompany
bonaparte
to
the
first
mass
held
in
paris
after
the
concordat
augereau
attempted
to
slip
out
of
the
carriage
during
the
procession
to
nôtre
dame
and
was
ignominiously
ordered
back
by
one
of
the
first
consuls
aidesdecamp
but
he
revenged
himself
by
laughing
and
talking
so
loudly
during
the
service
that
the
priest
could
hardly
be
heard
but
napoleon
knew
his
man
and
his
price
a
marshals
bâton
and
a
princely
income
did
much
to
control
his
jacobin
proclivities
as
early
as
1801
augereau
invested
part
of
his
savings
on
the
beautiful
estate
of
la
houssaye
where
when
not
actively
employed
he
spent
his
time
dispensing
lavish
hospitality
and
delighting
his
friends
and
military
household
with
magnificent
entertainments
himself
the
life
and
soul
of
the
whole
party
enjoying
all
the
fun
and
the
practical
jokes
as
much
as
the
youngest
subaltern
however
he
gained
his
money
he
spent
it
freely
and
ungrudgingly
when
the
first
consul
tried
to
put
lannes
in
an
awkward
position
by
ordering
him
at
once
to
replace
the
deficit
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
caused
by
the
magnificent
uniforms
he
had
ordered
for
the
guard
augereau
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
it
hurried
to
his
solicitors
and
told
them
to
pay
that
sum
to
general
lanness
account
when
bernadotte
whom
he
scarcely
knew
asked
him
to
lend
him
two
hundred
thousand
francs
to
complete
the
purchase
of
an
estate
he
at
once
assented
and
when
madame
bernadotte
asked
him
what
interest
he
would
require
he
replied
madame
bankers
and
moneylenders
no
doubt
quite
rightly
draw
profit
from
the
money
they
lend
but
when
a
marshal
is
fortunate
enough
to
oblige
a
comrade
the
pleasure
of
doing
him
a
service
is
enough
for
him

in
the
scheme
for
the
invasion
of
england
the
marshals
corps
which
was
stationed
round
brest
was
destined
for
the
seizure
of
ireland
so
when
the
grand
army
was
turned
against
austria
his
divisions
were
the
last
to
arrive
on
the
theatre
of
operations
and
were
directed
to
the
tyrol
where
they
forced
general
jellachich
and
most
of
his
army
to
surrender
in
the
following
year
the
marshal
greatly
distinguished
himself
at
jena
and
pultusk
but
at
eylau
though
not
owing
to
his
own
fault
he
suffered
a
reverse
the
emperor
had
placed
him
in
the
centre
of
the
first
line
and
ordered
him
to
advance
against
the
russian
centre
the
fog
and
snow
were
so
thick
that
the
french
could
not
see
the
foe
until
they
came
within
two
hundred
yards
of
them
the
enemy
suddenly
opened
fire
on
them
with
massed
batteries
in
a
moment
augereaus
staunch
divisions
were
cut
to
bits
by
the
hail
of
grape
and
owing
to
the
smoke
and
snow
they
could
not
see
their
foes
they
tried
to
hold
their
ground
and
reply
to
the
fire
but
at
last
they
wavered
and
broke
the
marshal
so
ill
with
fever
that
he
had
to
be
tied
to
his
horse
did
his
utmost
to
stop
the
rout
but
in
vain
at
last
wounded
and
sick
at
heart
he
had
to
return
and
report
his
failure
the
emperor
wishing
to
cover
his
own
mistake
laid
all
the
blame
for
the
illsuccess
of
the
day
on
augereau
and
breaking
up
the
remnants
of
his
corps
among
the
other
marshals
he
sent
him
home
afraid
however
of
arousing
his
enmity
and
mindful
of
his
past
services
next
year
he
created
him
duke
of
castiglione
but
he
never
entrusted
him
again
with
an
important
command
in
the
field
in
1809
the
marshal
was
sent
to
spain
to
supersede
st
cyr
at
the
siege
of
gerona
he
had
lost
his
lust
for
fighting
and
was
soon
recalled
for
not
showing
sufficient
energy
in
1812
he
commanded
part
of
the
reserve
of
the
grand
army
in
prussia
in
1813
he
was
in
command
of
a
corps
of
recruits
in
germany
and
was
present
at
leipzig
but
all
through
the
campaign
he
grumbled
against
his
troops
when
reproached
for
slackness
and
told
that
he
was
not
the
augereau
of
castiglione
he
turned
on
napoleon
crying
out
ah
give
me
back
the
old
soldiers
of
italy
and
i
will
show
you
that
i
am
still
he
had
no
heart
for
the
war
and
after
the
catastrophe
at
leipzig
he
broke
out
into
open
revolt
cursing
the
emperor
and
telling
macdonald
that
the
idiot
does
not
know
what
he
is
about

the
coward
he
abandoned
us
and
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
us
all
but
do
not
imagine
that
i
was
fool
enough
to
let
myself
be
killed
or
taken
prisoner
for
the
sake
of
a
suburb
of
leipzig
in
spite
of
this
in
1814
napoleon
was
so
hard
pressed
that
he
was
forced
to
employ
him
he
sent
him
to
lyons
with
orders
to
prevent
the
allies
from
debouching
from
switzerland
and
if
possible
to
fall
on
the
line
of
communication
of
schwartzenbergs
army
which
was
threatening
paris
and
he
implored
him
to
remember
his
former
victories
and
to
forget
that
he
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
but
old
age
and
luxury
had
snapped
the
once
famous
spirit
of
the
duke
of
castiglione
and
his
operations
round
lyons
were
contemptible
as
napoleon
said
at
st
helena
for
a
long
time
augereau
had
no
longer
been
a
soldier
his
courage
his
early
virtues
had
raised
him
high
above
the
crowd
but
honour
dignity
and
fortune
had
forced
him
back
into
the
ruck
accordingly
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
capitulation
of
paris
he
hoisted
the
white
cockade
and
issued
a
proclamation
saying
soldiers
you
are
absolved
from
your
oaths
you
are
so
by
the
nation
in
which
the
sovereignty
resides
you
are
still
more
so
were
it
necessary
by
the
abdication
of
a
man
who
after
having
sacrificed
millions
to
his
cruel
ambition
has
not
known
how
to
die
as
a
soldier
soon
after
this
he
met
his
former
emperor
and
benefactor
on
his
way
to
exile
at
elba
and
a
bitter
conversation
ensued
in
which
in
reply
to
the
emperors
recriminations
the
marshal
asked
of
what
do
you
complain
has
not
your
insatiable
ambition
brought
us
to
this

yet
when
the
emperor
returned
to
paris
augereau
threw
up
his
command
in
normandy
and
hastened
to
proffer
his
allegiance
but
napoleon
would
have
none
of
it
and
refused
him
place
or
preferment
after
waterloo
the
bourbons
also
showed
him
the
cold
shoulder
so
the
marshal
retired
to
his
country
seat
of
la
houssaye
where
he
died
on
june
11
1816
of
dropsy
on
the
chest
born
and
bred
a
paris
boy
he
had
lived
as
such
and
of
such
were
his
virtues
and
his
vices
physically
brave
yet
morally
a
coward
vain
blustering
yet
kindhearted
full
of
boisterous
spirits
greedy
yet
generous
liberal
by
nature
hating
control
yet
a
severe
disciplinarian
a
firm
believer
in
the
virtue
of
principles
yet
ever
ready
to
sacrifice
his
principles
at
the
altar
of
opportunity
augereau
in
spite
of
his
many
faults
knew
how
to
win
and
keep
the
love
of
his
soldiers
and
his
friends
a
leader
of
men
rather
than
a
tactician
or
strategist
he
played
on
the
enthusiasm
of
his
soldiers
by
example
rather
than
precept
unfortunately
for
his
reputation
his
moral
courage
failed
him
at
the
end
of
his
career
and
he
added
to
the
imputation
of
inconstancy
the
crime
of
ingratitude

guillaume
marie
anne
brune
marshal


guillaume
marie
anne
brune
poet
and
warrior
was
born
on
may
13
1763
at
briveslagaillard
his
father
who
belonged
to
a
legal
family
destined
his
son
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
and
after
giving
him
a
good
education
sent
him
to
finish
his
study
of
law
at
the
college
of
france
at
paris
but
the
boys
taste
did
not
lie
among
the
dull
technicalities
of
law
artistic
and
emotional
by
temperament
he
early
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
literature
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
published
his
first
work
half
prose
half
verse
in
which
he
described
a
holiday
in
poitou
and
angoumois
but
his
father
viewed
with
suspicion
his
sons
literary
aspirations
and
the
breach
between
them
widened
when
guillaume
married
a
young
burnisher
of
metal
angélique
nicole
pierre
the
orphaned
daughter
of
a
miller
from
arpajon
who
had
captivated
him
by
her
beauty
and
then
nursed
him
through
a
dangerous
illness
the
young
couple
were
thrown
entirely
on
their
own
resources
and
angélique
had
to
continue
her
burnishing
while
to
ensure
the
publication
of
his
works
brune
took
to
the
trade
of
printer
but
in
spite
of
poverty
and
hard
work
the
marriage
was
a
happy
one
for
angéliques
beauty
and
purity
of
mind
and
character
were
the
necessary
complement
to
her
husbands
artistic
desires
while
engaged
in
his
literary
work
brune
met
the
celebrated
mirabeau
who
introduced
him
to
his
friends
camille
desmoulins
and
danton
generous
by
nature
and
smarting
under
the
social
disgrace
which
followed
his
marriage
the
poet
turned
printer
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
philosophy
of
the
day
when
the
revolution
broke
out
he
hailed
the
new
era
with
delight
but
like
many
another
visionary
he
failed
to
see
the
cruel
necessities
which
the
revolution
was
bringing
in
its
train
following
the
example
of
his
friend
camille
desmoulins
on
september
15
1789
he
started
a
newspaper
the
magazin
historique
ou
journal
général
and
followed
up
this
speculation
by
editing
in
collaboration
with
gauthier
the
journal
de
la
cour
but
owing
to
the
violent
politics
of
gauthier
brune
broke
his
connection
with
the
paper
in
august
1790
as
the
revolution
grew
in
violence
and
blind
disorder
and
hate
took
the
place
of
his
dream
of
platonic
justice
eager
to
escape
from
cruelty
and
lust
the
printer
hastened
to
console
himself
among
those
who
were
hurrying
to
the
frontier
to
fight
the
enemy
as
the
only
means
of
getting
away
from
the
chaos
at
home
in
august
1791
he
enlisted
in
the
volunteers
of
the
seine
and
oise
and
within
a
few
weeks
his
activity
zeal
and
talent
for
administration
caused
his
comrades
to
elect
him
adjutantmajor
early
in
1792
he
joined
the
staff
of
the
army
as
assistant
adjutantgeneral
and
owing
to
the
influence
of
danton
and
his
political
friends
was
recalled
from
thionville
to
paris
in
september
1792
as
commissary
general
to
direct
and
organise
the
newly
raised
battalions
of
volunteers
but
when
he
arrived
in
paris
on
september
5th
and
found
the
streets
swimming
in
blood
and
danton
gloating
over
his
work
disgusted
with
paris
and
its
savage
population
he
at
once
applied
for
active
service
and
was
back
at
the
camp
of
meaux
in
time
to
take
part
in
dumouriezs
campaign
of
valmy
though
he
recoiled
from
their
methods
his
friendship
with
danton
and
camille
desmoulins
stood
him
in
good
stead
as
adjutantgeneral
he
served
at
neerwinden
and
after
that
battle
was
one
of
the
five
general
officers
chosen
to
rally
the
scattered
troops
of
the
army
of
the
north
in
july
he
was
ordered
to
calvados
to
assist
in
crushing
the
girondists
after
his
success
in
normandy
his
friends
offered
him
a
post
in
the
ministry
at
paris
but
he
loved
liberty
fair
and
free
as
she
existed
in
the
army
but
not
as
she
was
adored
in
paris
to
the
sound
of
the
tocsin
and
the
beat
of
the
générale
and
fierce
songs
of
death
trolled
out
by
cannibals
accordingly
he
returned
to
the
army
of
the
north
in
time
to
fight
under
houchard
at
handschötten
but
he
had
to
pay
the
penalty
for
his
friendship
with
the
terrorists
for
just
as
he
was
setting
out
full
of
delight
to
fight
the
english
at
dunkirk
owing
to
the
exigencies
of
political
strife
he
was
hurriedly
recalled
to
give
the
girondists
their
coupdegrâce
at
bordeaux

brune
returned
to
the
capital
in
1794
in
time
to
witness
the
fall
of
his
patron
danton
but
fortunately
for
him
barras
took
him
under
his
protection
and
in
october
thanks
to
his
influence
he
became
commandant
of
paris
for
a
whole
year
the
general
held
this
post
and
on
october
5th
commanded
the
second
column
while
bonaparte
with
the
first
column
ended
the
reaction
of
the
terror
with
a
few
rounds
of
grape
shot
still
under
the
patronage
of
barras
brune
spent
the
year
1796
in
pacifying
the
midi
and
his
work
there
has
been
admirably
portrayed
in
alexandre
dumas
les
compagnons
de
jéhu
where
he
figures
as
general
rolland
from
this
vexatious
and
wearisome
struggle
against
hostile
countrymen
he
was
summoned
to
italy
at
the
beginning
of
1797
and
was
present
with
massénas
division
at
the
battle
of
rivoli
under
masséna
he
fought
through
the
campaign
which
ended
at
leoben
and
attracted
the
notice
of
bonaparte
by
his
courage
and
goodwill
in
reward
for
his
services
he
was
created
general
of
division
from
italy
the
general
with
his
division
was
sent
in
october
to
join
the
army
of
england
while
marching
north
it
was
suggested
that
he
should
take
the
post
of
ambassador
at
berlin
but
when
the
troops
heard
of
this
offer
they
asked
the
adjutantgeneral
to
write
to
their
commander
saying
listen
general
your
division
charges
me
to
tell
you
not
to
give
up
fighting
the
division
will
bring
you
honour
and
that
is
much
better
than
an
embassy
however
there
was
to
be
no
question
of
an
embassy
for
on
february
7
1798
the
directors
sent
him
to
take
over
the
command
of
the
french
troops
whose
duty
it
was
to
annex
switzerland
to
france
this
was
the
generals
first
independent
command
and
though
the
campaign
added
to
his
military
reputation
unfortunately
it
left
a
stain
on
his
honour
the
war
was
entered
on
merely
with
the
desire
of
capturing
the
swiss
treasury
at
berne
and
thus
providing
funds
for
bonapartes
egyptian
expedition
brune
had
learned
his
lesson
in
italy
so
the
campaign
was
short
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
of
the
country
and
the
patriotism
of
the
swiss
writing
to
bonaparte
the
general
explained
the
cause
of
his
success
from
the
moment
i
found
myself
in
a
situation
to
act
i
assembled
all
my
strength
to
strike
like
lightning
for
switzerland
is
a
vast
barrack
and
i
had
everything
to
fear
from
a
war
of
posts
i
avoided
it
by
negotiations
which
i
knew
were
not
sincere
on
the
part
of
the
bernese
and
since
then
i
have
followed
out
the
plan
which
i
traced
to
you
i
think
always
i
am
still
under
your
command
the
crushing
of
the
swiss
peasantry
and
the
capture
of
berne
were
followed
by
the
hour
of
spoliation
no
less
than
one
million
seven
hundred
thousand
pounds
were
wrung
from
the
wretched
swiss
brune
himself
kept
his
own
hands
clean
and
was
as
he
wrote
constantly
paring
the
nails
of
rascals
and
taking
the
public
treasure
from
them
but
the
fact
that
he
was
officially
responsible
for
the
spoliation
and
that
his
own
share
of
the
plunder
was
thirtytwo
thousand
pounds
caused
his
name
to
be
loathed
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
switzerland
and
to
rob
like
a
brune
became
a
proverb
which
was
eagerly
seized
on
by
his
detractors

the
directors
pleased
with
his
operations
in
switzerland
despatched
brune
on
march
31
1798
to
take
command
of
the
army
of
italy
his
task
was
a
difficult
one
for
at
rome
and
mantua
the
starving
troops
had
mutinied
while
the
contractors
and
agents
of
the
directors
were
amassing
huge
fortunes
to
complicate
the
situation
the
general
was
encumbered
by
a
civil
commission
whose
duty
it
was
to
supervise
the
governments
of
the
cisalpine
republic
trouvé
the
moving
spirit
of
the
commission
had
but
one
idea
to
curb
the
growing
democratic
spirit
of
the
piedmontese
the
commanderinchief
whose
love
of
freedom
had
not
yet
been
blunted
violently
opposed
trouvé
and
at
last
forced
his
views
on
the
directory
and
trouvé
was
replaced
by
fouché
but
it
was
too
late
the
mischief
had
been
done
the
piedmontese
would
no
longer
bear
the
french
control
this
then
they
cried
is
the
faith
the
fraternity
and
the
friendship
you
have
brought
us
from
france
in
spite
of
brunes
efforts
to
restore
confidence
they
had
lost
all
faith
in
french
honour
and
on
december
6th
his
successor
found
himself
forced
to
expel
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
all
senators
opposed
to
the
french
interest

leaving
italy
in
november
brune
found
himself
sent
at
the
beginning
of
1799
to
holland
where
danger
was
threatening
it
was
evident
that
england
was
going
to
make
an
effort
to
regain
for
the
prince
of
orange
his
lost
possessions
in
spite
of
this
knowledge
as
late
as
august
the
french
commander
could
only
concentrate
ten
thousand
men
under
general
daendals
to
oppose
an
equal
force
of
english
under
abercromby
when
they
landed
on
the
open
beach
at
groete
keten
though
as
strong
as
the
enemy
general
daendals
made
the
most
feeble
attempt
to
oppose
the
landing
day
by
day
english
and
russian
reinforcements
poured
into
holland
till
at
last
they
numbered
fortyeight
thousand
but
the
duke
of
york
the
english
commanderinchief
had
a
hopeless
task
with
no
means
of
transport
no
staff
and
an
army
composed
of
hastily
enrolled
militia
recruits
and
insubordinate
drunken
russians
his
only
chance
of
success
lay
in
a
general
rising
of
the
dutch
for
early
in
september
the
french
forces
were
numerically
as
strong
as
his
own
abercrombys
opinion
was
that
defeat
would
mean
utter
disaster
were
we
to
sustain
a
severe
check
i
much
doubt
if
the
discipline
of
the
troops
would
be
sufficient
to
prevent
a
total
dissolution
of
the
army
while
the
english
opinion
of
the
russians
was
that
they
were
better
at
plundering
than
at
fighting
as
a
militiaman
wrote
the
russians
is
people
as
has
not
the
fear
of
god
before
their
eyes
for
i
saw
some
of
them
with
cheeses
and
bitter
and
all
badly
wounded
and
in
particklar
one
man
had
an
eit
day
clock
on
his
back
and
fiting
all
the
time
which
made
me
to
conclude
and
say
all
his
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
in
spite
of
this
the
english
had
some
considerable
tactical
success
and
drove
the
french
back
towards
amsterdam
but
lack
of
provisions
compelled
them
at
the
beginning
of
october
to
fall
back
on
their
entrenched
position
on
the
zype
fortunately
brune
who
had
been
much
impressed
by
the
fighting
powers
of
the
enemy
did
not
understand
how
difficult
it
would
have
been
for
them
to
reembark
their
forces
if
he
pressed
an
attack
he
allowed
some
of
his
staff
officers
to
throw
out
hints
of
an
armistice
and
convention
which
were
eagerly
accepted
for
on
october
20th
the
english
had
only
three
days
provision
of
bread
with
massénas
victory
at
zurich
and
the
embarkation
of
the
allies
after
the
convention
of
alkmaar
the
ring
of
foes
which
had
so
gravely
threatened
france
was
snapped
asunder
and
brune
although
he
had
shown
but
little
resource
or
initiative
during
the
fighting
in
holland
and
had
failed
to
diagnose
the
extremity
of
the
enemy
was
hailed
along
with
masséna
as
the
saviour
of
the
country
and
his
tactical
defeats
were
celebrated
as
the
victory
of
bergen

from
holland
the
conqueror
of
the
english
was
despatched
early
in
1800
by
the
first
consul
to
quell
the
rising
in
la
vendée
where
his
former
experience
of
guerilla
warfare
in
switzerland
stood
him
in
good
stead
and
he
soon
brought
the
rebels
to
their
knees
during
the
marengo
campaign
he
commanded
the
real
army
of
reserve
at
dijon
but
in
august
when
bonaparte
found
it
necessary
to
replace
masséna
he
despatched
brune
to
take
command
of
the
army
of
italy
unfortunately
the
future
marshals
genius
was
more
suited
to
the
details
of
administration
and
the
direction
of
small
columns
than
to
the
command
of
large
forces
in
the
field
though
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
and
supported
admirably
by
murat
marmont
macdonald
suchet
and
dupont
he
failed
conspicuously
as
a
commanderinchief
his
movements
at
the
crossing
of
the
mincio
were
hesitating
and
slow
and
he
neglected
to
seize
the
opportunity
which
duponts
successful
movements
presented
to
him
at
treviso
as
in
holland
he
showed
only
too
clearly
his
limitations
he
held
the
enemy
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
but
failing
to
see
his
advantage
he
once
again
signed
an
armistice
which
permitted
the
foe
to
escape
out
of
his
net

on
his
return
to
france
the
first
consul
regarded
him
with
suspicion
his
wellknown
republican
opinions
did
not
harmonise
with
bonapartes
schemes
of
selfaggrandisement
the
first
consul
had
a
very
poor
estimate
of
his
military
ability
but
the
people
at
large
still
hailed
him
as
the
saviour
of
holland
and
france
bonaparte
treated
him
like
all
those
whom
he
suspected
but
whom
he
could
not
afford
to
despise
and
under
the
pretext
of
a
diplomatic
appointment
he
practically
banished
him
to
constantinople
diplomacy
was
not
brunes
forte
and
after
eighteen
months
residence
in
turkey
he
was
obliged
to
quit
the
porte
which
had
fallen
entirely
under
russian
influence

the
general
was
still
abroad
when
the
emperor
created
his
marshals
his
appointment
of
brune
like
his
appointment
of
lefèbvre
was
part
of
his
scheme
for
binding
the
republican
interest
to
his
dynasty
for
his
opinion
of
the
marshals
talent
was
such
that
he
scarcely
ever
employed
him
in
the
field
from
1805
to
1807
brune
was
occupied
in
drilling
the
troops
left
at
boulogne
in
may
1807
he
was
appointed
to
command
the
reserve
corps
of
the
grand
army
and
when
in
july
the
king
of
sweden
declared
war
on
napoleon
he
was
entrusted
with
the
operations
round
stralsund
and
captured
that
fortress
and
the
island
of
rügen
during
this
short
campaign
the
marshal
had
an
interview
with
gustavus
of
sweden
and
tried
to
point
out
to
him
the
folly
of
fighting
against
france
a
garbled
account
of
this
interview
full
of
unjust
insinuations
came
to
napoleons
ears
in
anger
the
emperor
sent
for
brune
and
taxed
him
with
the
false
accusations
the
marshal
furious
that
his
good
faith
should
be
suspected
refused
any
explanation
and
merely
contented
himself
with
repeating
it
is
a
lie
the
emperor
equally
furious
at
his
obstinacy
deprived
him
of
his
command
the
result
of
this
quarrel
was
that
for
the
next
five
years
brune
lived
at
home
in
disgrace
on
the
restoration
he
made
his
submission
to
louis
xviii
and
received
the
cross
of
st
louis
but
in
1815
on
the
return
from
elba
he
answered
the
emperors
summons
for
napoleon
could
no
longer
afford
the
luxury
of
quarrelling
with
generous
frenchmen
who
were
willing
to
serve
him
remembering
the
marshals
talent
for
administration
and
a
war
of
posts
he
offered
him
the
command
of
the
midi
brune
hesitated
napoleon
had
treated
him
disgracefully
but
in
his
generosity
he
was
ready
to
overlook
all
that
still
he
knew
well
that
the
empire
was
not
the
republic
yet
he
preferred
napoleons
régime
to
that
of
the
bourbons
and
at
last
he
accepted
but
set
out
for
his
new
duties
depressed
and
not
at
all
himself
the
difficulties
he
had
to
contend
with
were
enormous
the
austrians
and
sardinians
were
massing
on
the
frontiers
the
allied
fleet
commanded
the
mediterranean
while
provence
was
covered
by
bands
of
brigands
who
called
themselves
royalists
marseilles
the
fickle
which
had
given
france
and
the
republic
the
marseillaise
was
now
redhot
legitimist
so
the
news
of
waterloo
and
of
napoleons
abdication
came
as
a
relief
to
the
harassed
marshal
who
was
only
too
glad
on
july
22nd
to
hand
over
toulon
to
the
english
thereon
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
the
king
he
set
out
for
paris

well
aware
of
the
disorder
in
the
midi
the
marshal
asked
lord
exmouth
the
commander
of
the
british
squadron
to
take
him
by
sea
to
italy
so
that
he
might
escape
the
danger
which
he
knew
threatened
him
from
the
hatred
of
the
royalists
unfortunately
for
the
fame
of
england
lord
exmouth
refused
in
the
rudest
terms
calling
him
the
prince
of
scamps
and
a
blackguard
accordingly
he
set
off
by
land
receiving
a
promise
of
protection
from
the
royalist
commander
but
no
escort
with
his
two
aidesdecamp
he
reached
avignon
in
safety
but
there
he
was
set
on
by
the
mob
chased
into
a
hotel
and
shot
in
cold
blood
and
his
body
thrown
into
the
rhône
a
fisherman
by
night
rescued
the
corpse
and
for
many
years
the
body
of
the
marshal
reposed
in
the
humble
grave
where
the
kindhearted
fisherman
had
placed
it
meanwhile
the
government
sanctioned
the
story
that
he
had
committed
suicide
but
at
last
the
persistence
of
his
widow
compelled
an
inquiry
when
the
truth
was
revealed
and
it
was
proved
without
doubt
that
the
murder
had
been
connived
at
by
the
authorities
the
inquiry
further
revealed
that
the
real
cause
of
the
marshals
death
was
not
so
much
the
measures
he
had
taken
to
stamp
out
the
bands
of
royalists
during
his
command
in
the
midi
as
his
old
connection
with
camille
desmoulins
and
danton
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
in
paris
during
the
september
massacres
and
that
he
was
constantly
employed
with
the
army
rumour
said
that
it
was
brune
who
had
carried
round
paris
the
head
of
the
princess
lamballe
on
a
pike
and
the
cunning
revival
of
this
story
by
the
leaders
of
the
white
terror
had
roused
the
mob
to
commit
the
outrage
the
story
was
absurd
the
archives
of
the
war
office
proved
beyond
doubt
that
he
was
not
in
paris
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
princess
strange
to
say
the
marshal
himself
years
before
seems
to
have
foretold
his
own
death
when
writing
about
the
terrorists
he
composed
the
following
lines

against
one
two
hundred
rise
assail
and
smite
him
till
he
dies
yet
blood
they
say
we
spare
to
spill
and
patriots
we
account
them
still
urged
by
martial
ardour
on
in
the
wave
their
victim
thrown
return
their
frantic
joy
to
fill
yet
these
men
are
patriots
still

though
his
faithful
wife
had
forced
the
authorities
to
remove
the
stain
of
suicide
from
the
marshals
fair
fame
it
was
not
till
1839
the
year
after
her
death
that
at
last
a
fitting
monument
was
raised
at
briveslagaillard
to
the
memory
of
the
marshal
who
whatever
his
failings
as
a
commander
might
be
had
lived
a
staunch
friend
a
true
patriot
a
courageous
soldier
and
had
twice
received
the
grateful
thanks
of
the
government
and
had
twice
been
acclaimed
as
the
saviour
of
his
country

adolphe
édouard
casimir
joseph
mortier
marshal
duke
of
treviso


édouard
mortier
was
born
near
cambrai
on
february
13
1768
his
father
a
prosperous
farmer
gave
the
future
marshal
a
fair
education
becoming
a
man
of
some
importance
on
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
he
was
able
in
1791
to
secure
for
his
son
a
commission
in
the
volunteer
cavalry
of
the
north
extremely
tall
heavily
built
slow
of
speech
with
a
stupid
sentinel
look
the
yeoman
captain
of
1791
gave
the
casual
observer
but
little
sign
of
promise
but
in
spite
of
those
rather
weary
looking
eyes
young
mortier
was
possessed
of
a
burning
enthusiasm
and
a
dauntless
courage
from
his
first
engagement
at
quiévrain
in
april
1792
where
he
had
a
horse
killed
under
him
to
the
day
he
and
marmont
surrendered
paris
in
1814
every
skirmish
or
engagement
in
which
he
took
part
bore
testimony
to
his
extraordinary
bodily
strength
and
bravery
nature
having
also
endowed
him
with
a
kindly
temperament
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
his
men
swore
by
him
and
were
ready
to
follow
him
anywhere
but
in
spite
of
many
gallant
actions
and
numerous
mentions
in
despatches
promotion
came
but
slowly
for
mortier
spent
the
first
six
years
of
his
service
with
the
armies
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
and
of
the
rhine
and
had
to
compete
against
such
men
as
soult
ney
st
cyr
kléber
and
desaix
who
were
on
a
higher
mental
plane
still
he
was
recognised
as
one
who
was
bound
to
rise
and
was
one
of
those
whom
kléber
singled
out
for
commendation
when
he
wrote
to
the
directory
saying
with
such
chiefs
a
general
can
neglect
to
count
the
number
of
his
enemies
and
well
he
might
for
on
the
day
after
he
wrote
his
report
mortier
with
a
single
battalion
and
four
squadrons
of
cavalry
having
been
ordered
to
try
and
drive
two
thousand
of
the
enemy
out
of
a
strong
position
on
the
wisent
attacked
them
with
such
vivacity
that
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
in
an
hour
he
drove
them
in
flight

after
the
campaign
in
1798
jourdan
sent
up
his
name
for
the
command
of
a
brigade
but
he
preferred
the
colonelcy
of
the
twentyfirst
regiment
of
cavalry
however
a
few
months
later
on
february
22nd
he
was
promoted
general
of
brigade
it
was
in
this
capacity
that
he
served
under
masséna
in
the
celebrated
campaign
in
switzerland
at
the
second
battle
of
zurich
he
did
yeoman
service
by
a
vigorous
demonstration
he
held
the
enemy
near
the
town
while
masséna
completed
his
turning
movement
he
further
distinguished
himself
by
his
vigour
and
resource
during
the
pursuit
of
the
russians
thus
he
won
his
promotion
to
general
of
division
on
september
25
1799
when
bonaparte
became
first
consul
mortier
found
no
cause
for
dissatisfaction
with
the
change
of
government
no
politician
he
was
ready
to
accept
any
strong
government
fortunately
for
him
his
dogged
character
and
his
fighting
record
attracted
the
first
consuls
attention
bonaparte
saw
in
him
a
man
without
guile
a
soldier
who
would
accept
any
order
from
his
chief
and
execute
it
instantly
without
questioning
still
it
was
a
great
piece
of
fortune
for
the
general
of
division
who
had
hitherto
held
no
independent
command
in
the
field
that
he
lay
with
his
troops
near
the
vaal
at
the
time
that
the
first
consul
determined
to
punish
england
for
her
suspicion
of
him
by
seizing
hanover
with
twenty
thousand
men
general
mortier
issued
from
holland
fell
suddenly
on
the
hanoverian
troops
at
borstel
on
the
weser
and
forced
count
walmoden
to
sign
a
convention
whereby
the
hanoverian
army
was
to
retire
behind
the
elbe
and
not
to
bear
arms
against
the
french
as
long
as
the
war
continued
the
english
government
refused
to
ratify
it
so
mortier
at
once
called
on
walmoden
to
resume
hostilities
but
so
unequal
was
the
contest
that
the
hanoverian
general
was
forced
to
accept
a
modified
form
of
the
former
convention
thereon
mortier
hurriedly
occupied
hamburg
and
bremen
and
closed
the
elbe
to
english
commerce
but
brilliant
as
his
operations
had
been
in
the
field
as
military
governor
of
the
ceded
provinces
he
established
a
reputation
for
great
rapacity
which
followed
him
throughout
his
career

napoleon
however
winked
at
his
generals
peculations
so
long
as
they
did
not
affect
his
treasury
and
he
showed
his
approbation
of
his
successful
campaign
by
making
him
one
of
the
four
commandants
of
the
guard
and
including
him
in
1804
among
the
first
creation
of
marshals
next
year
mortier
marched
to
germany
in
command
of
a
division
of
the
guards
when
after
ulm
the
army
was
reorganised
for
the
advance
on
vienna
a
new
corps
composed
of
the
division
of
dupont
and
gazan
was
entrusted
to
the
marshal
the
duty
he
was
to
perform
was
difficult
he
was
to
cross
the
danube
at
linz
and
unsupported
save
by
a
flotilla
of
boats
hang
on
the
russian
rear
while
the
rest
of
the
army
marched
on
vienna
by
the
right
bank
of
the
river
the
emperor
impressed
on
him
the
necessity
for
caution
and
warned
him
that
he
must
throw
out
a
ring
of
vedettes
and
keep
somewhat
behind
lanness
corps
which
was
marching
in
advance
of
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
unfortunately
the
marshal
in
his
eagerness
to
inflict
loss
on
the
russians
whom
he
believed
to
be
flying
in
complete
rout
neglected
all
warnings
and
pushed
recklessly
forward
at
dürrenstein
near
the
castle
where
richard
coeur
de
lion
was
imprisoned
by
the
archduke
of
austria
he
fell
into
a
trap
the
enemy
allowed
him
to
pass
the
defile
of
dürrenstein
with
gazans
division
knowing
that
dupont
was
many
miles
in
the
rear
and
then
closed
in
on
him
on
front
and
rear
with
but
seven
thousand
men
surrounded
by
thirty
thousand
russians
it
seemed
that
the
marshal
was
lost
but
he
kept
his
head
and
at
once
turned
about
to
try
and
break
back
and
join
dupont
who
he
knew
would
hurry
to
his
support
firing
at
pointblank
range
struggling
bayonet
against
bayonet
the
small
french
force
worked
its
way
towards
the
defile
darkness
fell
but
still
the
fight
continued
and
at
last
duponts
guns
were
heard
at
the
other
side
of
the
gorge
but
by
then
twothirds
of
gazans
division
had
fallen
three
eagles
were
taken
and
mortier
himself
conspicuous
by
his
towering
height
owed
his
safety
to
his
skill
with
his
sabre
his
officers
had
begged
him
to
escape
across
the
river
by
boat
lest
a
marshal
of
france
should
become
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
despised
russians
this
he
indignantly
refused
no
he
said
reserve
this
resource
for
the
wounded
one
who
has
the
honour
to
command
such
brave
soldiers
should
esteem
himself
happy
to
share
their
lot
and
perish
with
them
we
have
still
two
guns
and
some
boxes
of
grape
let
us
close
our
ranks
and
make
a
last
effort
but
still
the
russians
pressed
the
devoted
column
and
now
all
the
ammunition
was
expended
and
the
survivors
were
preparing
to
sell
their
lives
dearly
when
duponts
men
at
last
hurled
the
enemy
aside
and
amid
cries
of
france
france
you
have
saved
us
the
undaunted
remnant
of
gazans
division
threw
themselves
into
the
arms
of
their
comrades
on
the
morrow
the
sorely
battered
corps
was
recalled
across
the
danube
but
the
emperor
could
not
lay
all
the
blame
on
mortier
for
it
was
his
own
mistake
in
strategy
in
dividing
his
army
by
the
broad
danube
which
had
really
caused
the
disaster

in
1806
the
marshal
acted
independently
on
the
left
of
the
grand
army
and
after
occupying
cassel
and
hamburg
where
his
cruel
exactions
greatly
increased
his
reputation
for
rapacity
he
was
entrusted
with
the
operations
against
the
swedes
in
1807
however
he
was
called
up
to
reinforce
the
grand
army
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
decisive
battle
at
friedland
in
july
1808
napoleon
rewarded
him
by
creating
him
duke
of
treviso
a
month
later
he
despatched
him
to
spain
in
command
of
the
fifth
corps
which
was
composed
of
veterans
of
the
austrian
and
prussian
campaigns
very
different
from
the
recruits
of
the
third
corps
and
other
corps
in
spain
but
in
spite
of
this
magnificent
material
the
marshal
did
not
distinguish
himself
the
severe
reverse
he
had
received
at
dürrenstein
seemed
to
have
killed
his
dash
his
physical
bravery
remained
the
same
as
ever
but
his
moral
courage
had
deteriorated
and
in
spain
his
manoeuvres
were
always
halting
and
timid
at
saragossa
he
did
not
press
the
siege
with
the
vehemence
lannes
showed
when
he
superseded
him
but
at
the
battle
of
ocaña
he
showed
that
during
a
combat
his
nerve
was
as
good
as
ever
the
first
lines
of
the
french
broken
by
the
fire
of
the
spanish
battery
had
begun
to
waver
the
marshal
was
slightly
wounded
but
at
the
critical
moment
he
rode
up
to
girards
division
which
was
in
reserve
and
leading
it
through
the
intervals
of
the
first
line
he
caught
the
victorious
enemy
at
a
disadvantage
and
completely
turned
the
fortunes
of
the
day
the
remainder
of
the
duke
of
trevisos
service
in
the
peninsula
was
spent
under
the
command
of
marshal
soult
either
in
front
of
cadiz
or
as
a
covering
force
to
the
troops
occupied
in
that
siege
from
spain
he
was
recalled
in
1812
to
command
the
young
guard
in
the
russian
campaign
when
the
french
evacuated
moscow
the
marshal
at
the
emperors
commands
had
the
invidious
duty
of
blowing
up
the
kremlin
during
his
retreat
he
showed
himself
worthy
of
his
post
of
commander
of
the
young
guard
and
in
1813
in
the
same
capacity
he
fought
throughout
the
campaign
taking
his
share
in
the
battles
of
lützen
bautzen
dresden
leipzig
and
hanau
after
dresden
he
incurred
along
with
st
cyr
the
wrath
of
the
emperor
for
not
having
aided
vandamme
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
blame
of
the
disaster
at
külm
rests
entirely
on
napoleon
and
vandamme
no
orders
were
sent
to
mortier
or
st
cyr
till
after
the
disaster
had
occurred
and
vandamme
had
not
taken
the
most
elementary
precautions
against
surprise
in
1814
the
marshal
fought
gallantly
at
montmirail
and
troyes
but
like
victor
and
ney
he
showed
but
little
ingenuity
when
napoleon
made
his
last
dash
eastward
he
left
mortier
and
marmont
to
hold
off
the
prussians
from
paris
the
duke
of
treviso
though
far
senior
to
the
duke
of
ragusa
bowed
to
his
superior
genius
and
in
the
operations
ending
in
the
surrender
of
paris
he
carried
out
his
juniors
ideas
with
great
generosity
and
without
the
least
show
of
jealousy

like
the
rest
of
the
marshals
the
duke
of
treviso
made
his
submission
to
the
new
government
on
the
return
of
napoleon
he
for
a
time
kept
true
to
his
oath
to
the
bourbons
when
the
duke
of
orleans
who
shared
with
him
the
command
of
the
north
on
leaving
lille
wrote
to
him
i
am
too
good
a
frenchman
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
france
because
now
misfortune
compels
me
to
quit
it
i
go
to
hide
myself
in
retirement
and
oblivion
it
only
remains
for
me
to
release
you
from
all
the
orders
which
i
have
given
you
and
to
recommend
you
to
do
what
your
excellent
judgment
and
patriotism
may
suggest
as
best
for
the
interests
of
france
the
marshal
in
spite
of
his
decoration
of
st
louis
and
his
seat
as
a
peer
of
france
once
again
returned
to
his
old
allegiance
the
emperor
greeted
him
warmly
and
created
him
one
of
his
new
peers
and
in
june
sent
him
to
the
frontier
in
command
of
the
young
guard
but
an
attack
of
sciatica
forcing
him
to
bed
he
escaped
the
disaster
of
waterloo
on
the
second
restoration
he
lost
for
the
time
his
honours
and
dignities
but
refused
to
repurchase
them
at
the
price
of
sitting
as
judge
on
marshal
ney
however
in
1819
he
was
reinstated
in
all
of
them

it
was
not
till
the
accession
of
the
july
monarchy
that
the
duke
of
treviso
once
again
played
a
prominent
part
in
1831
his
old
friend
the
duke
of
orleans
now
become
king
made
him
grand
chancellor
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
in
november
1834
called
on
him
to
accept
the
onerous
task
of
head
of
the
government
and
minister
of
war
to
help
his
friend
and
sovereign
the
duke
accepted
the
responsibility
but
soon
found
that
he
was
unequal
to
the
task
a
frank
and
loyal
soldier
of
unimpeachable
honour
integrity
and
character
he
could
shine
in
the
field
but
not
in
the
forum
his
fine
lofty
figure
commanding
air
military
bearing
and
frankness
were
of
no
avail
in
the
chamber
of
peers
where
what
was
wanted
was
a
subtle
spirit
which
could
discern
and
influence
the
drift
of
parties
a
clear
facile
tongue
and
an
apparent
acquaintance
with
any
subject
which
might
come
up
for
discussion
these
were
the
very
qualities
in
which
the
marshal
was
most
lacking
slowwitted
by
nature
with
a
limited
vocabulary
and
a
bad
delivery
he
soon
found
himself
unfitted
for
the
post
and
resigned
in
february
1835
but
unfortunately
for
him
he
still
retained
his
position
as
grand
chancellor
and
in
this
capacity
he
attended
louis
philippe
on
his
way
to
the
illfated
review
of
july
29th
as
the
procession
arrived
at
the
boulevard
of
the
temple
the
marshal
complained
of
the
heat
his
staff
tried
to
persuade
the
old
soldier
to
go
home
but
he
refused
saying
my
place
is
by
the
king
in
the
midst
of
the
marshals
my
comrades
in
arms
scarcely
had
he
spoken
when
fieschi
hurled
the
fatal
bomb
which
missed
the
king
and
the
princes
but
killed
the
marshal
and
many
another
soldier

the
duke
of
treviso
while
doing
his
duty
by
his
sovereign
met
his
death
like
a
soldier
though
not
on
the
field
of
battle
as
with
davout
the
key
to
his
character
was
his
dogged
determination
but
though
he
resembled
the
prince
of
eckmühl
on
the
battlefield
he
had
not
his
powers
of
organisation
nor
his
clear
insight
into
matters
of
policy
and
strategy
but
he
had
other
qualities
which
davout
lacked
he
was
kindhearted
and
beloved
by
his
men
his
simplicity
and
faithfulness
appealed
to
napoleon
and
to
all
who
came
in
contact
with
him
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
emperor
entrusted
him
with
the
young
guard
what
distinguished
him
from
many
of
the
other
marshals
was
his
lack
of
jealousy
and
the
generous
way
in
which
he
cooperated
with
his
comrades
in
arms
when
the
funeral
procession
passed
down
the
rue
royale
on
its
way
to
the
church
of
the
invalides
with
four
marshals
on
horseback
holding
the
corners
of
the
pall
men
felt
and
felt
rightly
that
france
had
suffered
a
loss
for
one
was
gone
who
peasantborn
had
in
his
high
position
known
how
to
retain
the
simple
virtues
of
a
peasant
whose
one
vice
was
the
peasant
vice
of
avarice
and
who
with
this
exception
had
never
allowed
place
or
power
to
interfere
with
what
he
thought
was
his
duty

fidelity
and
conscientiousness
are
great
assets
in
lifes
race
and
to
these
jean
baptiste
bessières
added
great
presence
of
mind
and
considerable
dash
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
in
an
age
when
disinterestedness
and
reliability
were
notably
absent
among
public
men
his
force
of
character
pushed
him
above
the
ordinary
adventurers
and
caused
him
to
become
one
of
napoleons
most
trusted
lieutenants
the
marshal
was
born
at
prayssac
in
1768
his
father
a
surgeon
brought
up
his
son
in
his
own
profession
but
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
opened
a
wider
field
to
the
audacious
young
gascon
early
in
1792
jean
baptiste
quitted
cahors
and
the
medical
profession
and
started
off
to
paris
as
one
of
the
newlyenrolled
garde
constitutionnelle
his
fidelity
and
courage
were
soon
put
to
the
test
he
aided
the
royal
family
in
the
flight
to
varennes
and
consequently
had
to
seek
safety
in
retirement
but
the
life
of
a
soldier
was
as
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
and
three
months
later
he
managed
to
enlist
in
the
22nd
chasseurs
a
corps
which
formed
part
of
the
army
of
the
pyrenees
there
his
courage
and
ability
made
him
conspicuous
within
three
months
of
enlisting
he
was
promoted
sublieutenant
the
year
1793
proved
a
disastrous
one
for
france
defeat
followed
defeat
but
jean
baptiste
never
despaired
and
when
success
ultimately
smiled
on
the
french
arms
he
had
established
a
reputation
as
a
daring
and
capable
squadron
commander
still
like
many
another
of
the
successful
soldiers
of
the
age
bessières
owed
his
quick
promotion
to
his
early
friendship
with
the
great
corsican
it
was
murat
who
called
napoleons
attention
to
the
future
commander
of
the
imperial
guard
and
bonaparte
with
his
eagle
eye
at
once
appreciated
his
qualities
when
the
young
chief
formed
his
special
bodyguard
called
the
guides
he
placed
him
at
their
head
the
new
corps
was
composed
of
the
choicest
troops
and
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
imperial
guard
henceforward
bessières
became
his
chiefs
confidant
and
inseparable
friend
it
was
the
rare
fidelity
that
he
displayed
to
his
master
and
his
constant
attention
to
detail
his
intuitive
knowledge
of
his
commanders
requirements
and
his
energy
in
carrying
out
his
plans
rather
than
great
military
genius
which
accounted
for
the
emperors
lifelong
appreciation
of
the
commander
of
his
guides

at
lonato
and
castiglione
bessières
proved
the
correctness
of
the
young
corsicans
judgment
at
roveredo
he
broke
through
the
centre
of
the
austrian
infantry
and
with
six
others
captured
two
of
the
enemys
guns
at
the
first
battle
of
rivoli
in
accordance
with
his
generals
commands
he
laid
an
ambuscade
in
the
marsh
on
the
austrian
left
which
proved
the
decisive
factor
in
the
battle
in
the
following
year
he
again
distinguished
himself
at
the
second
battle
of
rivoli
and
at
the
siege
of
mantua
as
a
reward
for
his
services
bonaparte
sent
him
to
paris
with
the
official
despatches
and
the
stands
of
colours
won
from
the
enemy
and
at
the
end
of
the
campaign
promoted
him
full
colonel
and
as
a
further
mark
of
his
confidence
appointed
him
tutor
and
instructor
to
his
stepson
eugène
bessières
accompanied
bonaparte
to
the
east
and
served
by
his
side
in

the
commander
of

was
among
the
chosen
body
of

who
accompanied

on

in

he
helped

in

drawn
battle
of

faithful
as
he
had
proved
himself
in
war
he
showed
his
fidelity
in
peace
by
exposing
the
plot
of
the
artist
caracchi
and
thus
by
ties
of
gratitude
bound
himself
closer
to
the
first
consul
tall
goodlooking
with
a
graceful
figure
and
a
charming
smile
the
commandant
of
the
guard
captivated
everybody
by
his
intelligence
and
his
distinguished
bearing
which
had
a
piquant
flavour
by
reason
of
his
adherence
to
the
queue
and
powder
of
a
bygone
age

rejecting
the
brilliant
match
proposed
by
the
first

he
chose
as
his
bride
mademoiselle

a
young
lady
of
a
royalist
family
the
couple
were
married
by
a
nonjuring
priest
and
far
from
incurring
displeasure
were
greatly
complimented
for
bonaparte
already
desired
the
concordat
with

pope
and
saw
in
the
bride
a
useful
supporter
of
his
scheme
madame

was
a
great
social
success
a
favourite
of

a
close

and
confidant
of

everywhere
she
was
welcomed
for
her
beauty
her
force

and
the
charm
of
her
manner

during
the
year
of

and
the
preparation
for
the
invasion
of

bessières
accompanied
the
first
consul
on
all
his
numerous
expeditions
to
his
credit
be
it
said
he
protested
loudly
against
the
illjudged
execution
of
the
duc
denghien
when
the
first
consul
became
emperor
he
enrolled
his
friend
among
his
new
marshals
not
for
his
military
genius
but
as
a
reward
for
his
fidelity
for
none
knew
better
than
napoleon
how
lacking
the
new
marshal
was
in
many
of
the
requisites
of
a
great
commander

in
1805
the
cavalry
of
the
guard
formed
part
of
the
grand
army
and
their
commander
by
his
able
backing
of
murat
had
his
share
in
helping
to
win
the
battle
of
austerlitz
during
the
interval
between
the
austrian
and
the
prussian
campaigns
the
marshal
was
busily
occupied
in
paris
in
reorganising
and
expanding
the
guard
and
as
usual
was
in
close
touch
with
the
emperor
in
the
prussian
campaign
bessières
had
his
first
taste
of
an
independent
command
and
gained
great
credit
for
his
masterly
manoeuvring
in
poland
where
with
a
weak
force
he
kept
the
enemy
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
movements
of
the
french
and
covered
the
conjunction
of
the
various
corps
of
the
army

after
the
peace
of
tilsit
he
was
entrusted
with
the
delicate
mission
of
negotiating
a
marriage
between
princess
charlotte
of
würtemburg
and
prince
jerome
the
new
king
of
westphalia
hardly
had
he
returned
to
paris
when
he
was
hurried
off
again
on
active
service
this
time
to
spain
it
was
just
a
week
before
the
disaster
of
baylen
that
marshal
bessières
was
confronted
with
a
most
serious
problem
the
spanish
levies
from
old
castile
under
cuesta
had
effected
a
junction
with
the
levies
of
galicia
under
blake
and
were
threatening
to
overwhelm
the
weak
force
of
ten
thousand
men
with
which
the
marshal
was
attempting
to
put
down
the
guerilla
warfare
in
the
northern
provinces
bessières
had
not
been
the
great
emperors
confidant
for
nothing
and
he
at
once
saw
that
unless
he
took
the
initiative
his
force
was
doomed
for
the
enemy
were
in
overwhelming
strength
and
every
day
added
to
their
numbers
he
knew
well
how
illdisciplined
their
forces
were
and
he
determined
to
try
the
effect
of
a
surprise
everything
fell
out
as
he
wished
on
july
14th
he
found
the
spanish
armies
in
position
outside
medina
del
rio
seco
some
few
miles
east
of
valladolid
the
spaniards
not
knowing
whether
the
french
were
advancing
from
the
direction
of
valladolid
or
burgos
had
placed
the
army
of
blake
on
the
valladolid
road
and
that
of
cuesta
on
the
burgos
road
accordingly
the
marshal
was
able
to
surprise
and
defeat
blake
and
then
to
turn
and
inflict
a
similar
defeat
on
cuesta
so
far
his
dispositions
had
been
excellent
but
as
general
foy
said
he
could
organise
victory
but
he
could
not
profit
by
it
for
he
was
paralysed
by
the
extent
of
the
guerilla
warfare
with
which
he
was
faced
and
after
a
short
but
bloody
pursuit
he
called
off
his
troops
still
he
had
accomplished
much
for
the
time
he
had
dispersed
all
organised
resistance
in
the
northern
provinces
and
had
opened
the
road
to
madrid
for
king
joseph

but
baylen
and
vimeiro
proved
that
the
war
in
the
iberian
peninsula
was
still
only
in
its
first
stage
joseph
had
hastily
to
evacuate
madrid
and
in
spite
of
having
twelve
thousand
french
troops
under
his
command
bessières
could
effect
nothing
the
spanish
armies
of
cuesta
and
blake
once
again
took
shape
and
like
the
other
french
generals
the
marshal
had
to
fall
back
on
the
line
of
the
ebro
such
was
the
situation
in
october
when
the
emperor
himself
appeared
on
the
scene
the
situation
changed
like
magic
at
the
touch
of
a
master
hand
the
french
troops
strung
out
in
a
great
semicircle
on
the
ebro
were
quickly
concentrated
blake
and
cuesta
were
each
defeated
by
an
overwhelming
combination
of
the
different
french
armies
meanwhile
the
emperor
recognising
the
limitations
of
his
faithful
friend
superseded
him
by
soult
but
gave
him
the
command
of
the
guard
and
of
the
reserve
cavalry
under
his
own
immediate
supervision
and
took
him
back
to
france
when
he
gave
up
the
pursuit
of
the
english

napoleon
desired
to
take
the
guard
with
him
on
the
austrian
campaign
and
as
several
regiments
were
still
in
spain
others
had
to
be
enrolled
to
take
their
places
these
regiments
were
entirely
organised
by
bessières
and
formed
the
nucleus
of
what
was
later
called
the
young
guard
the
marshals
duty
during
the
austrian
campaign
of
1809
was
the
same
as
in
spain
the
command
of
the
guard
and
of
the
reserve
cavalry
during
the
famous
five
days
fighting
he
proved
again
that
no
troops
in
europe
could
resist
the
charges
of
the
heavy
cavalry
of
the
guard
and
that
he
himself
had
almost
as
great
a
command
of
the
technique
of
cavalry
tactics
as
his
famous
friend
and
instructor
the
king
of
naples
at
aspern
and
essling
the
cavalry
of
the
guard
and
the
reserve
cavalry
covered
themselves
with
glory
by
their
dashing
charges
again
and
again
with
cries
of
vive
lempereur
the
glittering
masses
of
cuirassiers
attempted
to
break
down
the
stern
handful
of
indomitable
hungarians
who
guarded
the
austrian
batteries
when
the
bridges
were
broken
and
the
retreat
to
the
island
of
lobau
was
the
only
hope
for
the
army
bessières
with
the
remains
of
cavalry
so
severely
punished
the
enemy
that
the
retirement
was
effected
in
safety
at
wagram
when
all
seemed
lost
napoleon
called
on
his
old
comrade
to
sacrifice
himself
with
his
cavalry
as
the
cuirassiers
of
the
guard
trotted
past
to
debouch
on
their
heroic
mission
the
emperor
waving
his
sword
cried
out
no
sabring
give
point
give
point
the
needed
time
was
gained
and
the
gallant
marshal
was
wounded
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
the
troopers
after
their
great
effort
could
no
longer
face
the
unbroken
lines
of
slowly
retreating
austrians
napoleon
chagrined
at
his
failure
met
his
cavalry
and
their
commander
with
reproach
was
ever
anything
seen
like
this
neither
prisoners
nor
guns
this
day
will
be
attended
with
no
result

the
emperors
illhumour
was
only
temporary
when
his
most
trusted
lieutenants
were
grumbling
and
longing
for
peace
in
which
to
enjoy
the
spoil
they
had
collected
in
war
when
bernadotte
and
fouché
were
openly
intriguing
against
him
napoleon
could
ill
afford
to
disregard
his
most
faithful
friend
accordingly
immediately
after
wagram
he
despatched
the
newly
created
duke
of
istria
to
belgium
to
take
over
the
command
of
the
french
troops
who
were
opposing
the
illfated
english
expedition
to
the
isle
of
walcheren
when
the
marshal
returned
from
belgium
to
paris
he
found
that
the
emperor
had
made
all
arrangements
for
the
divorce
of
josephine
and
for
his
second
marriage
bessières
was
placed
in
a
very
awkward
position
prince
eugène
was
his
greatest
friend
josephine
had
always
been
most
kind
to
him
and
the
duchess
but
he
could
not
help
them
in
any
way
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
emperor
insisted
on
coming
and
staying
with
him
at
his
country
house
at
grignon

meanwhile
the
war
in
spain
was
spoiling
many
great
reputations
reinforcements
were
urgently
required
so
the
emperor
decided
to
give
his
young
guard
their
baptism
of
fire
in
spain
accordingly
at
the
commencement
of
1811
he
despatched
them
with
bessières
their
commander
to
operate
on
the
northern
lines
of
communication
the
illsuccess
of
the
french
was
palpably
due
to
two
causes
there
was
no
commanderinchief
on
the
spotthe
emperor
was
in
parisand
there
was
no
other
marshal
whom
all
the
others
would
obey
secondly
there
was
a
great
want
of
concentration
as
bessières
wrote
to
berthier
all
the
world
is
aware
of
the
vicious
system
of
our
operations
everyone
sees
that
we
are
too
much
scattered
we
occupy
too
wide
an
extent
of
country
we
exhaust
our
resources
without
profit
and
without
necessity
we
cling
to
dreams
we
should
concentrate
our
forces
retain
certain
points
dappui
for
the
protection
of
our
magazines
and
hospitals
and
regard
twothirds
of
spain
as
a
vast
battlefield
which
a
single
victory
may
either
secure
or
wrest
from
us
unfortunately
the
marshal
was
human
like
his
comrades
and
instead
of
loyally
backing
up
masséna
he
came
to
an
open
rupture
with
him
on
the
question
of
supplies
and
by
his
inaction
at
fuentes
donoro
he
caused
the
french
to
lose
that
battle
though
he
made
good
his
excuses
before
napoleon
and
secured
the
disgrace
of
the
prince
of
essling
in
the
opinion
of
the
duke
of
wellington
it
was
bessièress
refusal
to
lend
masséna
assistance
which
was
entirely
responsible
for
the
french
defeat
moreover
sound
as
were
his
views
on
the
method
of
conducting
war
he
had
not
the
personality
to
impress
them
on
others
or
the
application
to
put
them
into
practice
and
his
whole
time
was
occupied
in
attempting
to
make
head
against
the
guerilla
warfare
his
methods
were
rough
and
barbarous
and
reacted
against
the
french
for
he
avenged
the
ill
deeds
of
the
guerillas
on
their
families
and
women
folk
and
visited
with
military
execution
any
village
which
failed
to
meet
his
onerous
requisitions
so
the
spaniards
retaliated
with
revenge
the
weapon
of
the
weak
that
wild
kind
of
justice
the
marshals
blunders
were
cut
short
by
his
recall
to
paris
at
the
beginning
of
1812
to
reorganise
the
guard
prior
to
the
russian
campaign

the
duke
of
istria
accompanied
the
emperor
to
the
front
his
individual
share
was
restricted
by
the
fact
that
the
king
of
naples
was
with
the
army
but
during
the
retreat
he
led
the
van
and
did
yeoman
service
in
restoring
order
among
the
disheartened
troops

early
in
1813
he
was
recalled
from
ebling
to
reorganise
the
guard
and
the
reserve
cavalry
the
task
tried
to
the
utmost
the
marshals
great
administrative
capacity
for
not
only
was
there
the
question
of
men
and
equipment
but
above
all
he
was
confronted
with
the
difficulty
of
providing
remounts
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
it
was
impossible
to
find
anything
like
enough
horses
for
the
cavalry
for
the
guns
had
to
be
supplied
first

the
marshals
share
in
the
campaign
was
short
at
lützen
on
the
eve
of
the
first
engagement
he
was
greatly
depressed
and
possessed
by
a
presentiment
of
death
which
proved
only
too
true
for
scarcely
had
the
battle
opened
when
he
was
struck
by
a
bullet
which
inflicted
a
mortal
wound

the
duke
of
istria
has
always
been
among
the
more
unknown
of
the
marshals
the
reason
for
this
is
clear
as
commander
of
the
cavalry
of
the
guard
and
organiser
of
the
young
guard
his
greatest
work
was
done
in
the
office
at
paris
disciplining
organising
equipping
and
supervising
the
instruction
of
these
picked
troops
his
greatest
talents
were
those
of
administration
as
a
cavalry
leader
in
the
field
he
was
overshadowed
by
the
brilliant
and
more
striking
king
of
naples
still
as
a
subordinate
he
possessed
some
sterling
qualities
as
is
proved
by
his
actions
during
the
great
five
days
and
by
the
fierce
fight
at
aspernessling
as
an
independent
commander
he
was
a
failure
again
and
again
his
moral
courage
seemed
to
desert
him
at
the
critical
moment
in
spain
at
medina
del
rio
seco
at
burgos
and
at
fuentes
donoro
he
could
not
brace
himself
to
take
the
responsibility
of
throwing
his
whole
weight
into
the
action
like
many
another
general
he
was
sound
but
he
was
unable
to
rise
to
the
height
of
those
great
commanders
who
intuitively
know
when
to
stake
their
all
consequently
although
he
undoubtedly
possessed
the
true
military
eye
as
is
shown
by
the
wonderful
way
he
covered
the
junction
of
the
french
corps
along
the
vistula
and
by
his
clearly
written
despatch
on
the
errors
of
the
war
in
spain
his
military
reputation
always
suffered
when
he
had
not
his
great
chief
close
at
hand
to
stiffen
his
determination
napoleon
knew
full
well
his
weakness
and
the
reproaches
he
hurled
at
him
at
wagram
were
not
altogether
without
ground
still
the
emperor
was
aware
that
bessièress
advice
was
always
valuable
because
of
his
clearness
of
vision
and
his
absolute
lack
of
all
bias
and
prejudice
and
while
he
made
allowances
for
his
lack
of
moral
courage
he
always
listened
to
him
attentively
the
army
believed
that
it
was
his
frantic
appeal
sire
you
are
seven
hundred
leagues
from
paris
which
deterred
the
emperor
at
moskowa
from
throwing
the
guard
into
the
action
and
thus
permitted
the
russians
to
escape
absolute
annihilation
as
a
man
the
marshal
was
loved
and
respected
by
all
for
his
absolute
disinterestedness
and
straightforwardness
he
was
adored
by
his
troops
while
he
possessed
the
qualities
which
enabled
him
to
succeed
in
the
difficult
task
of
establishing
an
iron
discipline
in
the
guard
it
was
due
to
him
that
in
the
imperial
guard
there
was
none
of
that
lawlessness
which
made
the
pretorians
of
rome
a
danger
to
the
empire
when
not
unnerved
by
responsibility
the
marshal
was
tenderhearted
to
an
extreme
at
moscow
he
was
foremost
in
saving
the
wretched
inhabitants
from
the
flames
during
the
horror
of
the
retreat
he
dashed
back
alone
to
a
deserted
camp
on
hearing
the
cries
of
an
infant
but
when
frightened
he
could
be
cruelty
itself
as
is
shown
in
his
terrible
decrees
against
the
spanish
guerillas
yet
even
in
spain
his
justice
was
appreciated
and
in
many
a
village
in
castile
on
the
news
of
his
death
masses
were
sung
for
his
soul
though
he
lacked
the
highest
moral
courage
his
physical
bravery
was
proven
on
many
a
stricken
field
from
valladolid
to
warsaw
at
st
helena
the
great
emperor
gave
his
friend
a
noble
epitaphhe
lived
like
bayard
he
died
like
turenne

claude
victor
perrin
marshal
duke
of
belluno


not
specially
dowered
by
fortune
with
talents
for
war
but
possessed
of
a
resolute
character
a
high
sense
of
honour
great
courage
and
that
intrepidity
which
napoleon
maintained
was
so
absolutely
essential
for
high
command
the
duke
of
belluno
is
a
striking
instance
of
how
large
a
factor
is
character
in
the
struggle
of
life
which
ends
in
the
survival
of
the
fittest
born
on
december
7
1764
at
la
marche
among
the
mountains
of
the
vosges
victor
perrin
enlisted
as
a
private
at
the
age
of
seventeen
in
the
artillery
regiment
of
grenoble
the
artillery
was
the
finest
arm
of
the
old
royal
army
for
there
and
there
alone
merit
not
favour
was
the
key
to
promotion
accordingly
the
future
marshal
served
his
apprenticeship
to
arms
under
officers
who
knew
their
service
and
loved
it
ten
years
spent
in
the
ranks
under
those
who
maintained
strict
discipline
and
were
themselves
punctilious
in
matters
of
duty
who
exercised
careful
supervision
over
their
men
and
matériel
and
made
a
serious
study
of
their
profession
the
art
of
warthese
years
with
their
example
were
not
thrown
away
on
the
young
soldier
when
in
1791
the
upheaval
of
the
revolution
threatened
to
subvert
the
service
claude
victor
now
a
sergeant
in
disgust
at
the
licence
prevailing
among
the
troops
applied
for
his
discharge
seven
months
of
civil
life
proved
enough
for
the
sturdy
exsergeant
and
in
october
he
enrolled
himself
in
the
volunteers
of
the
drôme
where
in
nine
months
he
forced
himself
by
strength
of
character
to
the
command
of
his
battalion
for
as
napoleon
aptly
said
the
times
of
revolution
are
the
occasions
for
those
soldiers
who
have
insight
and
courage
after
six
months
drill
under
the
hand
of
the
exartilleryman
the
volunteers
of
the
drôme
were
able
to
hold
their
own
on
the
parade
ground
with
the
best
regiments
of
the
line
well
might
their
commander
be
proud
of
his
battalion
in
the
fighting
on
the
var
victors
volunteers
greatly
distinguished
themselves
but
it
was
at
toulon
that
they
first
showed
their
real
worth
it
was
well
for
the
colonel
that
he
had
brought
his
troops
to
a
high
pitch
of
morale
for
on
starting
to
attack
mount
faron
general
dugommier
summoned
him
aside
we
must
take
the
redoubt
he
said
or
and
he
passed
his
hand
in
a
suggestive
way
across
his
throat
in
this
attack
alone
of
all
the
corps
engaged
the
men
of
the
drôme
stood
their
ground
when
the
english
made
their
counterattack
amid
cries
of
sauve
qui
peut
they
alone
replied
steadily
to
the
murderous
fire
of
the
enemy
and
as
quietly
as
on
parade
they
covered
the
rout
and
slowly
withdrew
in
good
order
three
weeks
later
came
the
opportunity
of
victors
life
in
the
assault
on
the
little
gibraltar
the
seizure
of
which
position
forced
the
english
to
evacuate
toulon
the
attack
was
planned
by
bonaparte
and
victor
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
chosen
as
one
of
the
leaders
he
was
already
the
firm
friend
of
the
corsican
captain
of
artillery
and
he
now
won
his
boundless
admiration
by
his
reckless
bravery
and
his
capacity
for
making
his
troops
follow
him
the
two
wounds
which
he
received
in
the
charge
which
carried
the
palisades
were
a
cheap
price
to
pay
for
the
rank
and
glory
which
he
was
later
to
gain
as
a
reward
for
the
way
in
which
he
flung
his
shattered
column
against
the
second
line
of
defence
his
immediate
recompense
was
the
post
of
general
of
brigade
in
the
army
of
the
eastern
pyrenees

from
the
spanish
campaign
victor
returned
in
1795
to
italy
with
an
enhanced
reputation
and
some
knowledge
of
mountain
warfare
which
was
to
stand
him
in
good
stead
later
when
in
1796
bonaparte
took
command
of
the
army
of
italy
he
found
victor
still
general
of
brigade
but
reputed
one
of
the
bravest
men
in
that
army
of
heroes
the
campaign
of
1796
brought
him
still
more
to
the
front
dego
mondovi
peschiera
san
marco
cerea
and
the
fights
round
mantua
proved
his
courage
and
capacity
to
exact
the
most
from
his
troops
but
it
was
his
manoeuvring
on
january
16
1797
at
saint
georges
outside
mantua
which
proved
his
real
ability
for
there
with
but
two
french
regiments
he
forced
the
whole
division
of
general
provera
seven
thousand
strong
to
lay
down
its
arms
bonaparte
chose
the
conqueror
of
provera
to
lead
the
french
army
to
invade
the
papal
states
this
was
victors
first
independent
command
but
owing
to
the
poor
condition
of
the
papal
troops
it
was
no
severe
test
of
his
ability
still
it
gained
for
him
his
step
as
general
of
division
and
confirmed
his
chiefs
high
opinion
of
him

during
the
year
following
the
peace
of
campo
formio
general
victor
held
several
posts
in
france
but
was
back
again
in
italy
in
1799
to
take
part
in
the
disastrous
campaign
against
the
austrians
and
russians
detached
by
general
moreau
to
aid
macdonald
on
the
trebbia
he
for
the
first
time
showed
that
jealousy
which
was
such
a
blemish
in
his
character
and
during
the
retreat
he
paid
so
little
attention
to
orders
that
he
was
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
enemy
not
from
cowardice
but
from
his
desire
to
escape
macdonalds
control
he
abandoned
his
guns
and
withdrew
into
the
mountains
to
try
to
join
moreau
but
macdonald
saved
the
guns
and
sarcastically
wrote
to
his
insubordinate
lieutenant
that
he
had
secured
the
guns
but
found
neither
friend
nor
foe

victor
was
serving
under
masséna
when
bonaparte
returned
from
egypt
stern
republican
sprung
from
the
ranks
he
hated
the
idea
of
a
dictatorship
and
did
not
hide
from
superiors
or
inferiors
his
dislike
of
the
coup
détat
of
the
18th
brumaire
indeed
so
subversive
of
discipline
became
his
attitude
and
his
speeches
to
his
soldiers
that
masséna
was
forced
to
remove
him
from
his
command
and
report
him
to
the
first
consul
in
retirement
and
disgrace
at
monaco
he
saw
with
dismay
the
armies
of
the
allies
surging
up
to
the
french
frontier
putting
aside
all
personal
animosity
he
wrote
to
his
former
friend
and
commander
with
no
complaints
or
prayers
to
be
reinstated
but
giving
a
clear
exposition
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
italy
and
of
the
means
necessary
to
restore
the
prestige
of
the
french
arms
and
actually
proposing
the
plan
which
the
first
consul
had
already
conceived
of
crossing
the
alps
and
falling
on
the
communications
of
the
enemy
bonaparte
was
greatly
struck
with
this
letter
perhaps
also
he
called
to
mind
his
former
friendship
in
the
days
when
the
old
exartillery
sergeant
used
to
walk
round
his
batteries
at
toulon
and
doubtless
he
remembered
his
stubborn
courage
and
tenacity
in
the
fights
round
mantua
at
any
rate
he
summoned
him
to
paris
received
him
with
marks
of
affection
and
sent
him
off
at
once
to
command
a
division
of
the
army
of
reserve
but
though
he
forgave
him
outwardly
bonaparte
was
too
shrewd
a
judge
of
men
not
to
see
that
his
old
comrade
was
always
dangerous
when
not
employed
while
busy
drilling
and
supervising
his
troops
the
general
had
no
time
to
think
about
politics
and
the
theories
of
government
so
as
first
consul
and
emperor
napoleon
saw
to
it
that
the
exartilleryman
had
plenty
of
employment
during
the
marengo
campaign
the
general
gained
fresh
honours
luckily
it
was
his
old
friend
lannes
with
whom
he
had
to
cooperate
and
lannes
willingly
acknowledged
his
loyal
aid
at
montebello
for
on
the
day
he
received
his
dukedom
he
embraced
victor
saying
my
friend
it
is
to
you
i
owe
my
title
at
marengo
he
again
had
to
work
with
lannes
and
it
was
due
to
their
admirable
cooperation
and
stubbornness
that
the
retreat
did
not
become
a
rout
and
that
desaix
had
time
to
return
to
the
field
and
allow
the
first
consul
to
fight
another
battle
and
turn
a
defeat
into
a
victory

but
though
napoleon
gave
him
his
due
share
of
the
glory
of
marengo
and
mentioned
him
first
in
despatches
and
presented
him
with
a
sword
of
honour
he
yet
remembered
his
former
hostility
and
while
constantly
employing
him
took
care
to
keep
him
as
much
as
possible
out
of
france
so
for
two
years
after
marengo
general
victor
held
the
post
of
commanderinchief
in
the
army
of
holland
then
in
1802
he
was
appointed
captaingeneral
of
louisiana
but
fortune
here
defeated
the
first
consuls
intentions
and
the
expedition
to
america
never
sailed
victor
was
sent
back
to
his
post
in
holland
and
kept
there
till
february
1805
when
he
was
appointed
minister
plenipotentiary
at
the
danish
court

during
these
years
it
was
clear
to
everybody
that
he
was
in
disgrace
and
it
was
due
to
the
boldness
of
his
friend
marshal
lannes
that
he
was
recalled
to
active
service
and
once
again
given
a
chance
of
distinguishing
himself
in
september
1806
owing
to
the
promotion
of
his
chief
staff
officer
lannes
had
to
find
a
new
chief
of
the
staff
for
his
corps
and
he
applied
to
the
emperor
to
be
allowed
to
appoint
general
victor
napoleon
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
mindful
of
the
number
of
troops
under
arms
and
the
necessity
of
employing
really
efficient
officers
on
the
staff
he
acquiesced
in
the
marshals
choice
saying
he
is
a
really
sound
man
and
one
in
whom
i
have
complete
confidence
and
i
will
give
him
proof
of
this
when
the
occasion
arrives
jena
and
pultusk
added
to
the
generals
distinguished
record
and
the
emperor
began
to
treat
him
once
again
with
favour
and
in
january
1807
entrusted
him
with
the
new
tenth
corps
of
the
grand
army
soon
after
he
had
taken
over
his
new
command
he
had
the
bad
luck
to
be
captured
by
a
patrol
of
the
enemy
while
driving
with
a
single
aidedecamp
near
stettin
luckily
for
him
he
had
by
now
completely
won
back
the
goodwill
of
the
emperor
napoleon
at
once
set
about
to
effect
his
exchange
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
back
again
with
his
corps
at
the
beginning
of
june
when
bernadotte
fell
ill
the
emperor
summoned
him
to
the
front
to
take
command
of
the
first
corps
and
it
was
in
this
capacity
that
he
was
present
at
the
battle
of
friedland
and
in
that
terrible
struggle
he
won
his
bâton
rewards
now
came
speedily
for
after
tilsit
he
was
entrusted
with
the
government
of
prussia
and
in
1808
created
duke
of
belluno

from
prussia
the
marshal
was
summoned
in
the
autumn
of
1808
to
take
command
of
the
first
corps
of
the
army
of
spain
and
for
the
next
three
years
he
saw
continuous
service
in
the
peninsula
during
the
first
few
months
of
his
career
there
fortune
smiled
upon
him
at
espinosa
he
dealt
general
blake
a
smashing
blow
later
he
led
the
van
of
the
army
under
napoleon
in
the
march
on
madrid
and
forced
the
enemys
entrenched
position
in
the
pass
of
the
somosierra
by
a
charge
of
his
polish
lancers
from
madrid
he
was
despatched
to
the
south
to
keep
the
enemy
at
some
distance
from
the
capital
and
at
ulces
and
medellin
he
proved
that
the
spanish
generals
were
no
match
for
him
and
his
seasoned
troops
but
unfortunately
he
smirched
the
fame
of
these
victories
by
the
licence
he
permitted
his
soldiers
at
ulces
he
allowed
the
town
to
be
sacked
and
executed
sixtynine
of
the
most
prominent
of
the
citizens
including
some
monks
while
he
ordered
all
prisoners
who
were
unable
to
march
to
be
shot
at
medellin
the
french
bayoneted
the
spanish
wounded
further
like
many
another
commander
he
did
not
scruple
to
make
the
most
of
his
successes
in
his
reports
and
the
spaniards
assert
that
he
eked
out
his
trophies
by
taking
down
the
old
battleflags
of
the
knights
of
santiago
from
the
church
of
ulces
after
medellin
his
successes
ended
placed
under
the
command
of
joseph
and
jourdan
whom
he
despised
in
great
straits
to
feed
his
army
in
a
country
which
was
really
a
wilderness
worried
by
constant
contradictory
orders
it
was
in
no
pleasant
mood
that
he
at
last
found
himself
under
the
personal
command
of
king
joseph
at
talavera
anxious
to
maintain
his
independence
and
to
show
off
his
military
skill
he
attempted
by
himself
to
surprise
the
english
wing
of
the
allied
army
consequently
he
committed
king
joseph
and
jourdan
to
an
action
which
they
did
not
wish
to
fight
and
by
refusing
to
cooperate
with
the
other
corps
commanders
he
brought
defeat
upon
the
french
army
for
as
napoleon
wrote
to
joseph
as
long
as
you
attack
good
troops
like
the
english
in
good
positions
without
reconnoitring
them
you
will
lead
your
men
to
death
en
pure
perte

after
talavera
victors
independent
career
came
to
an
end
he
was
placed
under
the
orders
of
marshal
soult
and
sent
to
besiege
cadiz
before
which
place
he
lay
till
he
was
summoned
to
take
part
in
the
russian
campaign
but
before
leaving
cadiz
he
fought
one
more
action
against
the
british
when
general
graham
seized
the
opportunity
of
soults
absence
to
attempt
to
break
up
the
siege
and
he
had
once
again
to
acknowledge
defeat
when
at
barossa
the
little
column
of
four
thousand
british
turned
at
bay
and
boldly
attacked
and
defeated
nine
thousand
chosen
french
infantry
under
the
marshal
himself

in
russia
the
duke
of
belluno
was
saved
some
of
the
greatest
hardships
for
his
corps
was
on
the
line
of
communication
and
it
was
not
till
the
day
before
the
battle
of
the
beresina
that
he
actually
joined
the
retreating
army
in
time
to
earn
further
glory
by
covering
the
passage
of
the
river
though
at
the
cost
of
more
than
half
his
corps
during
1813
he
fought
at
dresden
and
at
leipzig
and
at
the
commencement
of
1814
was
entrusted
with
the
defence
of
the
vosges
but
he
soon
had
to
fall
back
on
the
marne
at
saint
dizier
and
brienne
he
bore
himself
bravely
but
at
montereau
he
fell
into
disgrace
he
neglected
to
hold
the
bridge
on
the
seine
and
thus
completely
spoiled
napoleons
combination
the
emperor
was
furious
and
deprived
him
of
the
command
of
his
corps
and
told
him
to
leave
the
army
but
the
marshal
refused
to
go
i
will
shoulder
my
musket
said
he
victor
has
not
forgotten
his
old
occupation
i
will
take
my
place
in
the
guard
at
such
devotion
the
emperor
relented
well
victor
he
said
stretching
out
his
hand
remain
with
us
i
cannot
restore
to
you
your
corps
which
i
have
bestowed
on
girard
but
i
give
you
two
divisions
of
the
guard
however
the
marshal
did
not
long
occupy
his
new
position
for
he
was
severely
wounded
at
craonne
and
forced
to
go
home

on
napoleons
abdication
the
duke
of
belluno
swore
allegiance
to
the
bourbons
and
kept
it
for
on
the
return
of
napoleon
from
elba
he
withdrew
to
ghent
with
louis
xviii
on
the
second
restoration
he
was
created
a
peer
of
france
and
nominated
one
of
the
four
majorgenerals
of
the
royal
guard
though
never
an
imperialist
and
at
heart
a
republican
it
was
napoleons
treatment
of
him
at
montereau
which
recalled
the
old
grievance
of
his
disgrace
in
1800
and
turned
him
into
a
royalist
the
marshal
earned
the
undying
hatred
of
many
of
his
old
comrades
by
the
severity
he
displayed
when
charged
with
examining
the
conduct
of
officers
of
all
grades
who
had
served
under
the
usurpation
but
though
steadfast
in
his
adherence
to
the
monarchy
the
duke
of
belluno
still
clung
to
his
liberal
ideals
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
in
1821
villèle
invited
him
to
join
the
cabinet
as
minister
for
war
it
was
a
strange
position
for
the
exsergeant
of
artillery
but
he
filled
it
admirably
and
brought
considerable
strength
to
the
ministry
in
that
as
a
soldier
of
fortune
a
selfmade
man
he
conciliated
the
liberals
and
as
a
resolute
character
a
firm
royalist
and
a
man
of
intrepidity
and
honour
he
had
the
confidence
and
esteem
of
the
conservative
party
it
was
during
his
term
of
office
that
a
french
army
once
again
invaded
spain
and
thanks
in
no
small
degree
to
his
knowledge
of
the
country
and
to
his
business
capacity
that
it
suffered
no
reverse
when
the
bourbon
dynasty
fell
in
july
1830
the
duke
of
belluno
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
new
government
but
never
again
entered
public
life
and
on
march
1
1841
he
died
in
paris
at
the
age
of
seventyseven

emmanuel
de
grouchy
marshal


when
the
revolution
broke
out
in
1789
the
young
count
emmanuel
de
grouchy
was
serving
as
lieutenantcolonel
in
the
scotch
company
of
the
gardes
du
corps
born
on
october
23
1766
the
only
son
of
the
marquis
de
grouchy
the
representative
of
an
old
norman
family
which
could
trace
its
descent
from
before
the
days
of
william
the
conqueror
emmanuel
de
grouchy
had
entered
the
army
at
the
age
of
fourteen
after
a
years
service
in
the
marine
artillery
he
had
been
transferred
to
a
cavalry
regiment
of
the
line
and
on
his
twentieth
birthday
had
been
selected
for
the
gardes
du
corps
a
keen
student
of
military
history
and
devoted
to
his
profession
the
young
count
had
read
widely
and
thought
much
impressionable
and
enthusiastic
a
philosophical
liberal
by
nature
he
eagerly
absorbed
the
teaching
of
the
encyclopedists
as
events
developed
he
found
that
his
position
in
the
gardes
du
corps
was
antagonistic
to
his
principles
and
at
his
own
request
at
the
end
of
1791
he
was
transferred
to
the
twelfth
regiment
of
chasseurs
as
lieutenantcolonel
commanding
after
a
few
months
service
with
this
regiment
he
was
promoted
brigadiergeneral
and
served
successively
under
general
montesquieu
with
the
army
of
the
midi
and
under
kellermann
with
the
army
of
the
alps
at
the
commencement
of
1793
while
on
leave
in
normandy
he
was
hurriedly
despatched
to
the
west
to
take
part
in
the
civil
war
in
la
vendée
no
longer
comte
de
grouchy
but
plain
citizengeneral
grouchy
for
the
next
three
years
he
saw
almost
continuous
service
in
the
civil
war
with
the
exception
of
a
few
months
when
like
all
cidevant
nobles
he
was
dismissed
the
service
by
the
decree
of
the
incompetent
bouchotte
but
clanclaux
who
commanded
the
army
of
la
vendée
had
found
in
him
a
most
useful
subordinate
and
a
sound
adviser
and
accordingly
at
his
instance
the
cidevant
noble
was
restored
to
his
rank
and
sent
back
as
chief
of
the
staff
to
the
army
of
the
west
and
in
april
1795
promoted
general
of
division
clearheaded
firmly
convinced
of
the
soundness
of
his
opinions
without
being
bigoted
or
revengeful
grouchy
saw
that
the
cruel
methods
of
many
of
the
generals
did
more
to
continue
the
war
than
the
political
tenets
of
the
vendéens
and
chouans
and
he
used
his
influence
with
clanclaux
and
later
with
hoche
to
restrain
useless
reprisals
and
crush
the
rebellion
by
overwhelming
the
armed
forces
of
the
rebels
not
by
insulting
women
and
shooting
prisoners
the
problem
to
be
solved
was
a
difficult
one
as
he
pointed
out
in
a
memoir
written
for
clanclaux
it
is
the
population
of
the
entire
country
which
is
on
your
hands
a
population
which
suddenly
rushes
together
to
fight
if
it
is
strong
enough
to
crush
you
which
hurls
itself
against
your
flanks
and
rear
and
then
as
suddenly
disappears
when
not
strong
enough
to
resist
you
his
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
to
wear
down
resistance
by
light
mobile
columns
and
to
starve
the
enemy
out
by
devastating
the
country
in
september
1795
on
clanclauxs
retirement
the
commissioners
attached
to
the
army
of
the
west
wished
to
invest
grouchy
with
the
command
but
the
general
refused
the
post
for
clear
counsellor
and
good
adviser
as
he
was
he
lacked
selfconfidence
and
knew
that
he
was
not
fit
for
the
position
it
was
this
horror
of
undertaking
responsibility
which
dragged
him
down
during
all
his
career
and
which
on
the
two
occasions
when
fortune
gave
him
his
chance
to
rise
made
him
choose
the
safe
but
inglorious
road
of
humdrum
mediocrity
in
1796
came
his
first
chance
after
a
brief
period
of
service
with
the
army
of
the
north
in
holland
he
was
once
again
at
his
old
work
under
hoche
in
the
west
when
the
directory
determined
to
try
to
retaliate
for
the
english
participation
in
the
chouan
revolt
by
raising
a
hornets
nest
in
ireland
at
the
end
of
december
a
force
of
fifteen
thousand
men
under
hoche
with
grouchy
as
second
in
command
set
sail
for
ireland
unfortunately
the
expedition
met
with
bad
weather
the
ship
on
which
hoche
sailed
got
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
fleet
and
when
grouchy
arrived
at
the
rendezvous
in
bantry
bay
he
found
the
greater
part
of
the
expedition
but
no
generalinchief
in
spite
of
this
he
rightly
determined
to
effect
a
landing
but
had
not
the
necessary
force
of
character
to
ensure
his
orders
being
carried
out
and
after
six
days
procrastination
admiral
bouvet
pleading
heavy
weather
refused
to
allow
his
ships
to
remain
off
the
coast
and
the
expedition
returned
to
france
if
grouchy
had
been
able
to
get
his
orders
obeyed
all
would
have
been
well
for
on
the
very
day
after
his
squadron
left
bantry
bay
hoche
himself
arrived
at
the
rendezvous
as
grouchy
said
if
he
had
only
flung
that

admiral
bouvet
into
the
sea
all
would
have
been
right
where
grouchy
hesitated
and
failed
a
napoleon
would
have
acted
and
conquered

hoche
died
and
grouchy
who
under
his
influence
had
disapproved
of
the
policy
of
france
towards
the
italian
states
at
once
accepted
employment
in
italy
he
soon
had
to
rue
his
decision
for
he
found
himself
entrusted
with
the
task
of
using
underhand
means
to
drive
the
king
of
sardinia
from
his
country
still
he
obeyed
his
orders
to
the
letter
during
negotiations
he
secretly
introduced
french
troops
into
the
citadel
at
turin
and
then
seized
the
fortresses
of
novara
alessandria
and
chiasso
meanwhile
he
terrified
the
unfortunate
monarch
by
announcing
the
arrival
of
imaginary
columns
of
troops
suborned
the
kings
council
and
so
worked
on
the
feelings
of
the
bewildered
sovereign
that
he
escaped
by
night
from
his
palace
and
fled
across
the
sea
but
though
their
king
had
deserted
them
the
piedmontese
did
not
tamely
submit
and
for
the
next
few
months
the
general
was
busy
tracking
out
and
capturing
the
numerous
members
of
the
secret
societies
who
were
avenging
their
country
by
cutting
the
throats
of
frenchmen
while
striking
with
a
heavy
hand
at
these
conspirators
grouchy
was
levelheaded
enough
to
understand
that
the
proper
method
of
tackling
the
problem
was
to
remove
the
grievance
in
his
opinion
it
was
not
the
people
so
much
as
the
church
which
was
opposed
to
the
french
and
accordingly
he
did
his
best
to
get
joubert
to
issue
a
proclamation
that
there
should
be
no
interference
with
religion
still
the
situation
must
have
been
galling
to
a
man
of
culture
and
a
theoretical
liberal
for
while
forcing
democratic
institutions
on
an
unwilling
people
he
had
at
the
same
time
to
strip
their
capital
of
all
objects
of
art
and
while
issuing
proclamations
for
the
freedom
of
religion
he
had
to
arrange
for
the
passage
of
the
pope
on
his
way
to
captivity
in
may
1799
the
general
was
recalled
from
his
governorship
of
turin
for
the
austrians
and
russians
were
invading
lombardy
and
joubert
was
concentrating
his
forces
the
campaign
as
far
as
grouchy
was
concerned
was
short
for
while
attempting
to
stem
the
flight
of
the
left
wing
after
the
battle
of
novi
he
was
ridden
over
and
captured
by
the
allies
four
sabre
cuts
one
bullet
wound
and
several
bayonet
thrusts
kept
him
in
hospital
for
some
time
when
he
was
well
enough
to
be
moved
he
was
sent
to
grätz
and
it
was
not
till
a
year
laterin
june
1800that
his
exchange
was
effected
but
he
soon
had
his
revenge
on
the
austrians
for
in
the
autumn
he
was
despatched
to
join
the
army
under
moreau
which
was
operating
on
the
danube
and
arrived
at
headquarters
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
in
the
face
of
a
blinding
snowstorm
grouchys
division
drove
back
the
main
column
of
the
enemy
and
after
hours
of
murderous
handtohand
fighting
in
the
forest
he
shared
with
ney
the
honour
of
the
last
charge
which
drove
the
enemy
in
hopeless
rout

it
was
on
his
return
from
hohenlinden
that
the
excount
met
bonaparte
the
first
consul
who
aimed
at
conciliating
the
old
nobility
made
much
of
him
employed
him
on
a
confidential
mission
to
italy
and
nominated
him
inspectorgeneral
of
cavalry
this
post
admirably
suited
grouchy
who
was
a
horseman
by
nature
and
a
cavalry
soldier
by
instinct
later
on
the
formation
of
the
army
of
the
ocean
he
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
an
infantry
division
in
marmonts
corps
in
holland
and
it
was
with
marmont
that
he
made
the
campaign
of
1805
in
october
1806
he
was
summoned
from
italy
to
a
more
important
command
the
grand
army
was
advancing
on
prussia
and
napoleon
had
need
of
capable
leaders
to
command
his
vast
masses
of
cavalry
grouchy
was
entrusted
with
the
second
division
of
dragoons
of
the
cavalry
corps
under
murat
and
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
battle
of
prinzlow
and
the
pursuit
to
lübeck
at
eylau
he
had
a
narrow
escape
his
charger
was
killed
in
the
middle
of
the
mêlée
and
he
was
only
saved
by
the
devotion
of
his
aidedecamp
though
much
shaken
he
was
able
to
resume
command
of
his
division
and
distinguished
himself
by
his
fierce
charges
in
the
blinding
snow
at
friedland
a
chance
occurred
for
which
his
capacity
proved
fully
equal
murat
was
absent
at
königsberg
trying
to
get
across
the
enemys
rear
and
grouchy
was
in
command
of
all
the
reserve
cavalry
at
the
moment
the
advance
guard
interrupted
the
russian
retreat
it
was
his
admirable
handling
of
the
cavalry
under
lanness
directions
which
held
the
russians
in
check
for
sixteen
hours
until
napoleon
was
able
to
concentrate
his
divisions
and
give
the
russians
the
coupdegrâce
the
emperor
showed
his
gratitude
by
presenting
the
general
with
the
grand
cross
of
baden
investing
him
with
the
cordon
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
granting
him
the
domain
of
nowawies
in
the
department
of
posen

the
following
year
1808
saw
grouchy
now
a
count
of
the
empire
with
murat
in
spain
acting
as
governor
of
madrid
but
when
in
the
autumn
joseph
evacuated
all
the
western
provinces
grouchy
whose
health
had
been
much
shaken
by
the
polish
campaign
was
granted
leave
of
absence
and
took
care
not
to
be
sent
back
for
he
had
seen
enough
of
the
spanish
to
foresee
the
terrible
difficulties
of
guerilla
warfare
moreover
the
annexation
of
the
country
was
contrary
to
his
ideas
of
political
justice
when
the
war
with
austria
was
imminent
napoleon
sent
him
to
italy
to
command
the
cavalry
of
the
viceroys
army
with
prince
eugène
he
fought
through
styria
and
carinthia
and
distinguished
himself
greatly
at
the
battle
of
raab
at
wagram
his
cavalry
was
attached
to
davouts
corps
and
his
fierce
charges
which
helped
to
break
the
austrian
left
brought
him
again
under
the
notice
of
the
emperor
who
showed
his
appreciation
by
appointing
him
colonelgeneral
of
chasseurs

in
1812
the
count
was
summoned
once
again
to
the
field
to
command
the
third
corps
of
reserve
cavalry
with
the
grand
army
in
russia
at
moskowa
his
cuirassiers
sabre
in
hand
drove
the
russians
out
of
the
great
redoubt
but
grouchy
himself
was
seriously
wounded
during
the
retreat
from
moscow
he
commanded
one
of
the
sacred
bands
of
officers
who
personally
guarded
the
emperor
but
his
health
never
good
completely
broke
down
under
the
strain
and
he
was
allowed
to
return
straight
home
from
vilna
a
year
elapsed
before
he
had
sufficiently
recovered
to
take
the
field
and
it
was
not
till
the
beginning
of
1814
that
he
was
fit
for
service
during
the
campaign
in
france
first
under
victor
and
later
with
marmont
he
commanded
the
remnant
of
the
reserve
cavalry
but
on
march
7th
at
craonne
he
was
once
again
so
badly
wounded
that
he
had
to
throw
up
his
command

during
the
restoration
grouchy
remained
at
his
home
his
relations
with
the
bourbons
were
not
cordial
and
he
bitterly
resented
the
loss
of
his
title
of
colonelgeneral
of
chasseurs
accordingly
when
napoleon
returned
from
elba
and
france
seemed
to
welcome
him
with
open
arms
in
spite
of
having
accepted
the
cross
of
st
louis
he
had
no
scruple
in
answering
the
emperors
summons
he
was
entrusted
with
the
operations
against
the
duc
dangoulême
round
lyons
but
disliked
the
task
for
he
remembered
the
fate
of
the
duc
denghien
and
in
spite
of
napoleons
protests
that
he
only
desired
to
capture
the
duke
in
order
to
make
the
austrians
send
back
the
empress
grouchy
determined
that
if
possible
while
doing
everything
to
defeat
the
royalists
he
would
not
capture
dangoulême
unfortunately
the
duke
refused
the
opportunity
to
escape
which
was
offered
him
and
grouchy
had
to
make
him
a
prisoner
however
napoleon
anxious
to
stand
well
with
the
powers
of
europe
at
once
ordered
him
to
be
set
free
at
the
same
time
he
sent
grouchy
to
command
the
army
of
the
alps
giving
him
his
marshals
bâton
the
new
marshal
was
delighted
with
his
promotion
he
had
now
served
for
twenty
years
as
general
of
division
and
although
only
fortynine
had
practically
given
up
all
hope
of
promotion
but
scarcely
had
he
reached
his
new
command
when
he
was
recalled
to
paris

with
murat
in
disgrace
and
bessières
dead
the
emperor
had
no
great
cavalry
leader
on
whom
he
could
rely
and
remembering
the
new
marshals
exploits
at
friedland
and
wagram
and
his
staunchness
in
1814
he
determined
to
entrust
him
with
the
command
of
the
reserve
cavalry
unfortunately
for
napoleon
and
grouchy
the
exigencies
of
the
campaign
forced
the
emperor
to
divide
his
army
so
while
entrusting
ney
with
a
part
of
his
troops
with
orders
to
pursue
the
english
and
keeping
the
guard
and
reserves
under
his
immediate
control
he
gave
grouchy
the
command
of
two
corps
of
infantry
and
one
of
cavalry
in
all
some
thirtythree
thousand
men
the
appointment
was
an
unfortunate
one
for
the
marshal
though
in
many
respects
a
good
cavalry
leader
had
never
before
had
the
command
of
a
large
body
of
mixed
troops
and
even
his
cavalry
successes
had
been
obtained
when
under
the
orders
of
a
superior
at
friedland
he
was
under
lannes
at
wagram
under
davout
at
moskowa
under
eugène
and
in
1814
under
either
victor
or
marmont
but
what
was
most
unfortunate
about
the
selection
was
that
grouchy
had
not
enough
personal
authority
to
enforce
his
orders
on
his
corps
commanders
and
the
fiery
vandamme
not
only
despised
but
hated
him
because
he
had
received
the
bâton
which
he
hoped
was
to
have
been
his
while
girard
was
a
personal
enemy
at
ligny
where
napoleon
himself
supervised
the
attack
all
went
well
but
from
the
moment
fighting
ceased
difficulties
began
immediately
after
the
battle
the
emperor
entrusted
the
marshal
with
the
pursuit
of
the
prussians
but
pajol
who
commanded
his
light
cavalry
carried
out
his
reconnaissance
in
a
perfunctory
manner
and
reported
that
the
prussians
had
retreated
towards
namur
grouchy
received
this
news
at
4
am
on
june
17th
but
he
did
not
dare
to
disturb
the
emperors
rest
and
it
was
8
am
before
he
could
see
him
and
demand
detailed
orders
napoleon
trusting
to
pajols
report
thought
that
the
prussians
were
absolutely
demoralised
and
were
leaving
the
theatre
of
war
and
so
he
kept
the
marshal
talking
about
paris
and
politics
till
11
am
consequently
it
was
1130
before
he
received
exact
orders
penned
by
bertrand
which
told
him
to
proceed
to
gembloux
keeping
his
forces
concentrated
to
reconnoitre
the
different
roads
leading
to
namur
and
maestricht
and
to
inform
the
emperor
of
the
prussians
intentions
adding
it
is
important
to
know
what
blücher
and
wellington
mean
to
do
and
whether
they
prefer
to
unite
their
armies
in
order
to
cover
brussels
and
liège
by
trying
their
fortunes
in
another
battle
bad
staff
directions
and
heavy
rains
retarded
the
advance
and
it
took
six
hours
for
the
troops
to
cover
the
nine
miles
to
gembloux
where
at
eight
in
the
evening
grouchy
heard
that
part
of
the
prussians
had
fallen
back
on
wavre
which
meant
that
they
might
still
unite
with
the
english
to
cover
brussels
he
at
once
reported
this
to
the
emperor
adding
that
blücher
had
retired
on
liège
and
the
artillery
on
namur
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
on
the
evening
of
the
seventeenth
napoleon
knew
that
this
was
a
mistake
and
that
the
prussians
were
actually
massed
round
wavre
it
was
not
till
10
am
on
the
morning
of
waterloo
that
he
sent
to
the
marshal
informing
him
of
the
prussians
concentration
and
telling
him
that
he
must
therefore
move
thither
ie
to
wavre
in
order
to
approach
us
and
to
push
before
him
any
prussians
who
may
have
stopped
at
wavre
this
was
the
exact
course
which
grouchy
had
determined
to
pursue
it
is
therefore
quite
clear
that
neither
the
emperor
nor
the
marshal
had
dreamed
that
blücher
would
attempt
to
give
any
assistance
to
the
english
in
their
position
at
waterloo
at
11
am
when
his
columns
were
just
approaching
wavre
the
marshal
heard
the
commencement
of
the
cannonade
at
waterloo
girard
entreated
him
to
march
to
the
sound
of
the
cannon
but
grouchy
had
what
he
considered
distinct
orders
to
pursue
the
prussians
he
was
now
in
touch
with
them
and
with
a
force
of
thirtythree
thousand
men
he
did
not
dare
to
make
a
flank
march
in
the
face
of
what
he
was
becoming
convinced
was
the
whole
prussian
army
at
5
pm
he
received
napoleons
despatch
hastily
written
at
1
pm
ordering
him
to
turn
westward
and
crush
the
prussian
corps
which
was
marching
on
the
emperors
right
rear
but
by
then
his
main
force
was
heavily
engaged
at
wavre
and
even
if
he
had
been
able
to
despatch
part
of
his
force
it
could
not
have
arrived
at
mont
st
jean
till
long
after
the
end
of
the
battle

on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
the
marshal
was
preparing
to
pursue
thielmanns
corps
which
on
the
previous
evening
he
had
driven
from
wavre
when
he
heard
of
the
catastrophe
at
waterloo
he
immediately
stopped
the
pursuit
and
by
rapid
marching
reached
namur
before
the
allies
could
cut
him
off
and
by
a
skilful
retreat
brought
back
his
thirtythree
thousand
men
to
paris
before
the
enemy
arrived
at
the
gates
but
instead
of
the
thanks
he
had
expected
he
found
himself
saddled
with
the
blame
of
the
loss
of
waterloo
the
disaster
however
clearly
rested
on
the
emperor
whose
orders
were
vague
and
who
had
not
realised
the
extraordinary
moral
courage
of
blücher
and
the
stubbornness
of
the
prussians
and
if
napoleon
did
not
foresee
this
he
could
not
blame
grouchy
for
being
equally
blind
the
marshal
did
all
that
a
mediocre
man
could
do
he
carefully
carried
out
the
orders
given
him
trusting
no
doubt
too
much
to
the
letter
too
little
to
the
spirit
but
long
years
spent
in
a
subordinate
position
under
a
military
hierarchy
like
that
of
the
empire
were
bound
to
stifle
all
initiative
and
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
man
who
twenty
years
earlier
had
failed
to
rise
to
the
occasion
in
ireland
would
after
at
last
gaining
his
marshals
bâton
risk
his
reputation
by
marching
like
desaix
at
marengo
to
the
sound
of
the
guns
across
the
front
of
an
enemy
vastly
superior
to
himself
through
a
difficult
country
partially
waterlogged
and
intercepted
by
deep
broad
streams
contrary
to
what
seemed
his
definite
orders

the
marshals
career
really
ended
on
the
abdication
of
the
emperor
though
he
was
appointed
by
the
provisional
government
to
the
command
of
the
remains
of
the
army
of
the
north
and
in
this
capacity
proclaimed
the
emperors
son
as
napoleon
ii
on
gaining
paris
he
found
himself
subordinate
to
davout
an
old
enemy
accordingly
he
threw
up
his
command
and
retired
into
private
life
after
his
conduct
during
the
hundred
days
he
could
expect
no
mercy
from
the
returned
bourbons
and
was
glad
to
escape
abroad
included
in
the
general
pardon
he
returned
to
france
in
1818
but
his
marshalate
was
annulled
and
he
never
regained
his
bâton
though
on
the
accession
of
charles
x
he
was
actually
received
at
court
but
though
the
king
might
forgive
his
favourites
and
ministers
could
not
forget
and
in
december
1824
he
was
included
among
the
fifty
generals
of
napoleon
who
were
placed
on
the
retired
list
an
action
which
general
foy
shrewdly
remarked
was
a
cannonshot
charged
at
waterloo
fired
ten
years
after
the
battle
and
pointed
direct
at
its
mark
like
many
another
of
the
marshals
the
veteran
retained
his
health
and
faculties
for
many
years
and
defended
his
character
and
actions
and
criticised
his
enemies
with
the
same
clear
logic
which
had
so
powerfully
contributed
to
his
early
advancement
for
the
exmarshal
wielded
the
pen
as
easily
as
the
sword
it
was
not
till
1847
that
death
carried
off
the
sturdy
old
warrior

the
age
of

when
old
institutions
suddenly
collapse
with
a
crash
when
all
is
confusion
and
chaos
and
the
lines
of
reconstruction
are
as
yet
veiled
in
uncertainty
when
people
suspect
their
old
rulers
and
are
shy
of
those
who
would
set
themselves
up
as
their
new
directors
there
comes
an
interval
before
genius
and
wile
can
organise
their
forces
when
character
and
character
alone
can
shepherd
the
people
scattered
like
sheep
on
the
mountains
such
was
the
case
in
france
in
september
1792
the
old
constitution
had
foundered
sweeping
away
in
its
ruin
the
order
and
discipline
of
the
royal
army
the
officers
had
either
fled
or
been
deposed
by
their
men
and
such
few
as
remained
were
held
suspect
the
new
officers
chosen
by
their
fellows
had
but
little
authority
the
staff
of
the
army
was
changed
weekly
to
suit
the
whim
of
some
civil
or
military
selfseeker
at
a
time
when
france
was
at
war
with
the
great
military
powers
of
europe
it
was
little
wonder
therefore
that
the
prussians
and
austrians
looked
forward
to
the
campaign
of
1792
as
a
military
promenade
they
knew
better
even
than
the
war
minister
at
paris
how
debauched
were
the
regular
troops
of
france
how
unreliable
and
contemptible
were
the
few
thousand
old
men
and
boys
who
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
volunteers
and
they
never
for
a
moment
believed
that
the
french
generals
would
be
able
to
force
their
men
to
stand
and
fight
but
they
had
calculated
wrongly
they
had
not
learned
that
in
war
a
man
is
everything
they
had
not
grasped
how
deeply
the
spirit
of
discipline
had
been
engrained
in
the
old
royal
army
fortunately
for
france
she
had
two
men
of
character
to
fall
back
upon
and
aided
by
their
example
on
september
20th
the
regulars
of
france
stood
firm
before
the
famous
prussian
army
the
two
men
were
dumouriez
and
kellermann
dumouriez
had
brains
and
character
kellermann
character
and
stolid
imperturbability

descended
from
an
old
saxon
family
long
domiciled
in
alsace
françois
christophe
kellermann
was
born
at
strasburg
on
may
28
1735
entering
the
french
army
at
the
age
of
fifteen
he
fought
his
way
up
step
by
step
by
sheer
hard
work
and
merit
winning
the
cross
of
st
louis
for
distinguished
cavalry
work
in
the
seven
years
war
he
was
sent
in
1766
on
a
mission
to
poland
and
russia
on
the
strength
of
which
he
was
lent
by
the
french
government
to
help
the
confederates
of
bar
to
organise
their
irregular
cavalry
returning
to
france
he
slowly
gained
promotion
and
in
1788
became
majorgeneral
and
was
promoted
lieutenantgeneral
in
march
1792
mainly
owing
to
his
warm
adoption
of
the
revolutionary
principles
kellermann
had
not
the
gifts
of
a
great
commander
but
he
had
what
is
sometimes
better
the
confidence
of
his
men
he
was
notorious
for
his
hatred
of
the
old
régime
and
had
a
high
reputation
as
a
cavalry
commander
added
to
this
the
firm
belief
he
had
in
himself
served
to
inspire
confidence
in
others
independent
by
nature
ambitious
cantankerous
jealous
and
conceited
kellermann
had
not
found
his
life
in
the
army
any
too
pleasant
save
in
war
time
merit
gained
little
reward
promotion
came
neither
from
the
east
nor
the
west
but
from
court
favouritism
it
thus
happened
that
the
rough
alsatian
had
always
found
himself
subordinate
to
men
who
were
really
his
inferiors
but
who
despised
his
want
of
culture
and
his
provincial
accent
for
kellermann
knew
no
grammar
spoke
through
his
nose
and
spelt
as
he
spoke
even
writing
debuté
for
deputé
it
was
thanks
to
the
friendship
of
servan
the
war
minister
that
on
august
25th
he
was
summoned
from
the
small
column
he
had
been
commanding
on
the
lauter
to
succeed
luckner
in
command
of
the
army
of
the
centre
when
he
arrived
at
his
new
headquarters
at
metz
he
found
a
woeful
state
of
affairs
the
prussians
and
austrians
were
sweeping
everything
before
them
and
at
metz
he
found
a
fortress
without
stores
and
an
army
without
discipline
luckily
he
had
the
advantage
of
berthier
a
staff
officer
of
the
highest
order
napoleons
future
chief
of
the
staff
the
soldiers
welcomed
kellermann
this
brave
general
whose
patriotism
equals
his
talents
and
whose
civism
was
praised
throughout
all
alsace
organisation
was
his
first
work
and
his
former
experience
of
irregular
warfare
in
poland
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
immediately
sent
home
the
battalions
of
the
volunteers
of
1792
who
were
arriving
without
arms
and
in
rags
he
retained
a
few
picked
men
from
each
battalion
to
be
used
as
light
troops
and
pioneers
after
weeding
out
undesirables
and
drafting
reinforcements
into
his
most
reliable
regiments
in
three
weeks
he
evolved
a
force
of
twenty
thousand
men
capable
of
taking
the
field
while
thus
engaged
he
was
ordered
to
join
dumouriez
who
had
been
holding
the
prussians
in
check
at
the
defiles
of
the
argonne
on
the
evening
of
september
19th
kellermann
effected
his
junction
with
dumouriez
near
st
menehould
and
was
attacked
early
next
morning
by
the
enemy
under
the
duke
of
brunswick
the
morning
was
wet
and
foggy
and
the
prussians
surprised
the
french
and
cut
them
off
from
the
road
to
paris
but
instead
of
driving
home
their
attack
they
thought
to
frighten
them
by
a
mere
cannonade
luckily
the
artillery
was
the
least
demoralised
part
of
the
french
army
and
under
the
able
command
of
dabbéville
it
not
only
replied
to
the
prussian
guns
but
played
with
great
effect
on
the
infantry
when
at
last
brunswick
ordered
an
attack
kellermann
meanwhile
sat
on
his
horse
in
front
of
his
infantry
and
by
his
example
and
sangfroid
managed
to
keep
them
in
the
ranks
though
they
were
really
so
unsteady
that
when
an
ammunition
wagon
blew
up
three
regiments
of
infantry
and
the
whole
of
the
ammunition
column
fled
in
disorder
from
the
field
but
kellermann
galloped
up
in
time
to
prevent
the
panic
spreading
meanwhile
dumouriez
had
hastened
up
reinforcements
to
secure
kellermanns
flanks
and
the
duke
of
brunswick
seeing
the
french
standing
firm
and
not
being
sure
of
his
own
men
refused
to
allow
the
attack
to
be
pressed
home
such
was
the
cannonade
of
valmy
the
prussians
had
thirtyfour
thousand
men
engaged
and
lost
one
hundred
and
eightyfour
men
the
french
had
thirtysix
thousand
engaged
out
of
a
total
of
fiftytwo
thousand
and
lost
three
hundred
and
the
greater
proportion
of
this
loss
was
due
to
kellermanns
bad
tactics
in
massing
his
infantry
close
behind
his
guns

kellermann

valmy
from
an
engraving
after
the
painting
by
ansiaux

still
valmy
was
one
of
the
most
important
battles
in
the
worlds
history
for
it
taught
europe
that
france
still
existed
as
a
political
unit
and
it
allowed
her
to
effect
her
regeneration
in
her
own
way
neither
kellermann
nor
dumouriez
at
first
understood
what
they
had
done
dumouriez
drew
off
his
army
to
a
better
position
to
await
events
but
valmy
had
restored
the
morale
of
the
french
and
broken
that
of
the
prussians
whom
disease
and
bad
weather
further
affected
and
soon
brunswick
was
glad
to
negotiate
and
retreat
to
the
rhine
kellermanns
share
in
the
great
event
is
easily
determined
he
had
most
unwillingly
joined
dumouriez
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
surprised
in
the
morning
and
his
tactics
were
so
bad
that
his
men
suffered
heavier
loss
than
was
necessary
but
though
it
was
dumouriez
who
made
good
the
tactical
mistake
and
covered
kellermanns
flanks
and
dabbéville
whose
artillery
caused
the
infantry
attack
to
miscarry
it
was
kellermanns
reputation
and
example
which
kept
the
really
demoralised
infantry
in
line
and
prevented
them
from
running
in
terror
from
the
field
it
was
the
sight
of
the
old
alsatian
quietly
getting
on
a
fresh
horse
when
his
former
one
was
killed
caring
nothing
though
one
of
his
coattails
was
carried
off
by
a
round
shot
which
breathed
new
life
and
courage
into
the
masses
of
waiting
men
and
taught
them
to
cry
out
vive
la
nation
vive
la
france
vive
notre
général
so
though
men
might
smile
when
they
heard
the
old
boaster
talking
of
my
victory
yet
in
their
hearts
they
knew
he
had
done
much
to
save
france

while
the
prussians
retreated
kellermann
was
entrusted
by
dumouriez
with
the
pursuit
on
his
return
to
paris
his
boasting
habits
brought
him
into
trouble
the
terrorists
hearing
him
constantly
talking
of
my
men
my
army
were
afraid
he
was
getting
too
powerful
and
he
very
nearly
came
to
the
scaffold
restored
to
favour
he
was
employed
with
the
army
of
the
alps
and
the
army
of
italy
in
1794
and
1795
where
he
gained
some
success
although
his
plans
were
constantly
interfered
with
by
the
committee
of
public
safety
in
1796
the
army
of
the
alps
was
made
subordinate
to
the
army
of
italy
under
bonaparte
and
the
directory
wanted
to
associate
kellermann
with
bonaparte
but
the
future
conqueror
of
italy
would
brook
no
equal
especially
a
cantankerous
boaster
so
he
wrote
to
carnot
if
you
join
kellermann
and
me
in
command
in
italy
you
will
undo
everything
general
kellermann
has
more
experience
than
i
and
knows
how
to
make
war
better
than
i
do
but
both
together
we
shall
make
it
badly
i
will
not
willingly
serve
with
a
man
who
considers
himself
the
first
general
in
europe
when
however
bonaparte
came
to
power
he
did
not
forget
the
old
alsatian
in
1800
he
made
him
one
of
his
senators
and
in
1804
he
created
him
a
marshal
though
not
in
the
active
list
but
exigencies
of
warfare
demanded
that
france
should
use
all
her
talents
and
in
every
campaign
the
emperor
entrusted
the
old
warrior
with
the
command
of
the
army
of
the
reserve
sometimes
on
the
rhine
sometimes
on
the
elbe
sometimes
in
spain
the
old
soldier
taught
the
recruits
of
the
grand
army
how
to
keep
themselves
and
their
muskets
clean
and
in
spite
of
age
and
infirmities
showed
those
talents
of
organisation
which
he
had
learned
in
poland
and
earlier
still
in
the
seven
years
war
in
1808
when
creating
his
new
nobility
the
emperor
cleverly
conciliated
the
republican
party
by
creating
the
marshal
duke
of
valmy
and
presenting
him
with
a
splendid
domain
at
johannisberg
in
germany
but
when
the
end
came
in
1814
the
duke
of
valmy
like
the
other
marshals
quietly
accepted
the
restoration
and
the
veteran
republican
now
in
his
eightieth
year
was
created
a
peer
of
france
and
accepted
the
command
of
the
third
military
division
during
the
hundred
days
he
held
no
command
and
on
the
restoration
he
retired
into
private
life
and
died
at
paris
on
september
23
1820
his
body
was
buried
in
paris
but
his
heart
according
to
his
directions
was
taken
to
valmy
and
interred
beside
the
remains
of
those
who
had
fallen
there
and
a
simple
monument
was
placed
over
the
spot
with

to

as
the

has
been
so
unjustly
caricatured
in

accordingly
the
record
of
this
hardfighting
soldier
of

has
been
cruelly
buried
in
ridicule
the
son
of
an
old
private

had
to
supplement
their
income
and
madame
went
out
charring
while
the
sergeant
taught
alsatian
which
he
called
german
and
occupied
his
spare
moments
in
instructing
his
wife
in
reading
and
writing
but
the
revolution
suddenly
changed
their
outlook
on
september
1
1789
lefèbvre
was
granted
a
commission
as
lieutenant
in
the
newly
enrolled
national
guard
as
a
recompense
for
the
devotion
shown
to
the
officers
when
the
guards
mutinied
within
the
next
two
years
he
further
showed
his
devotion
to
the
lawful
authorities
and
was
twice
wounded
while
defending
the
royal
family
but
in
spite
of
personal
attachment
to
the
bourbons
the
prussian
invasion
turned
him
into
a
republican
and
the
republic
as
idealised
by
the
warmhearted
warriors
of
the
armies
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
and
of
the
rhine
became
the
idol
of
his
heart
from
the
siege
of
thionville
in
1792
till
he
was
invalided
in
1799
lefèbvre
was
on
continuous
active
service
his
extraordinary
bravery
his
knowledge
of
his
profession
and
his
absolute
devotion
to
his
duty
brought
him
quick
promotion
for
he
became
captain
in
june
1792
lieutenantcolonel
in
september
1793
brigadier
two
months
later
and
general
of
division
on
january
18
1794
the
stern
battle
of
fleurus
in
june
1794
proved
that
the
general
of
division
was
worthy
of
his
rank
for
it
was
his
counterattack
in
the
evening
which
decided
the
fate
of
the
day
the
early
years
of
the
republican
wars
were
times
when
personal
bravery
audacity
and
devotion
worked
marvels
on
the
highly
strung
enthusiastic
republican
troops
and
lefèbvre
had
these
necessary
qualifications
while
his
alsatian
accent
and
kindheartedness
won
the
devotion
of
his
men
he
was
highly
appreciated
by
his
commanderinchief
jourdan
who
in
his
official
report
stated
that
the
general
added
to
the
greatest
bravery
all
the
necessary
knowledge
of
a
good
advance
guard
commander
maintaining
in
his
troops
the
strictest
discipline
working
unceasingly
to
provide
them
with
necessaries
and
always
manifesting
the
principles
of
a
good
republican
unswerving
devotion
to
dutyi
am
a
soldier
i
must
obeywas
the
guiding
principle
of
his
career
and
accordingly
each
commander
he
served
under
had
nothing
but
praise
for
the
thoroughness
with
which
he
did
his
work
from
the
enforcement
of
petty
regulations
to
the
covering
of
a
defeated
force
but
in
spite
of
this
the
exsergeant
knew
his
worth
and
did
not
fear
to
claim
his
due
when
hoche
in
his
general
order
after
the
battle
of
neuweid
stated
that
the
army
had
taken
seven
standards
of
colours
lefèbvre
naïvely
wrote
to
him
it
must
be
fourteen
altogether
for
i
myself
captured
seven
but
hoche
had
both
humour
and
tact
and
made
ample
amends
by
replying
there
were
only
seven
stands
of
colours
as
there
is
only
one
lefèbvre

by
1799
seven
years
continuous
fighting
had
begun
to
tell
on
a
physique
even
as
strong
as
lefèbvres
and
the
general
applied
for
lighter
work
as
commander
of
the
directory
guard
and
later
for
sick
leave
but
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
against
the
archduke
charles
in
the
valley
of
the
danube
once
again
stimulated
his
indefatigable
appetite
for
active
service
though
suffering
from
scurvy
and
general
overstrain
he
took
his
share
in
the
hard
fighting
at
feldkirche
and
ostrach
but
a
severe
wound
received
in
the
latter
combat
at
last
compelled
him
to
leave
the
field
and
go
into
hospital

on
his
return
to
france
he
was
entrusted
by
the
directory
with
the
command
of
the
17th
military
district
with
paris
as
its
headquarters
the
task
was
a
difficult
one
as
the
numerous
coups
détat
had
shaken
both
public
morality
and
military
discipline
among
other
unpleasantnesses
the
commander
of
paris
found
himself
on
one
occasion
forced
to
place
a
general
officer
in
the
abbaye
the
civil
prison
for
flatly
refusing
to
obey
orders
but
difficult
as
his
task
was
the
situation
became
much
more
complicated
by
the
sudden
return
of
bonaparte
from
egypt
bonaparte
arrived
in
paris
with
the
fixed
determination
to
assume
the
reins
of
government
it
was
clear
to
so
staunch
a
republican
as
lefèbvre
that
all
was
not
well
with
the
republic
under
the
directory
and
it
seemed
as
if
bonaparte
shimmering
in
the
glamour
of
italy
and
egypt
was
the
sole
person
capable
of
conciliating
all
parties
and
of
bringing
the
state
of
chronic
revolution
to
an
end
directly
he
met
the
famous
corsican
the
simple
soldier
fell
an
easy
victim
to
his
personality
while
bonaparte
was
quick
to
perceive
what
a
great
political
asset
it
would
be
if
lefèbvre
the
republican
of
the
republicans
the
embodiment
of
the
republican
virtues
could
be
bound
a
satellite
in
his
train
on
the
morning
of
the
18th
brumaire
the
commander
of
the
paris
division
was
the
first
to
arrive
of
all
the
generals
whom
the
plotter
had
summoned
to
his
house
he
was
puzzled
to
find
that
troops
were
moving
without
his
orders
and
he
entered
in
considerable
anger
bonaparte
at
once
explained
the
situation
the
country
was
in
danger
foes
were
knocking
at
the
door
and
meanwhile
the
republic
lay
the
prey
of
a
pack
of
lawyers
who
were
exploiting
it
for
their
own
benefit
without
thought
of
patriotism
now
then
lefèbvre
said
he
you
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
republic
are
you
going
to
let
it
perish
in
the
hands
of
these
lawyers
join
me
in
helping
to
save
our
beloved
republic
look
here
is
the
sword
i
carried
in
my
hand
at
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
i
give
it
to
you
as
a
token
of
my
esteem
and
of
my
confidence
lefèbvre
could
not
resist
this
appeal
his
warm
and
generous
nature
responded
to
the
artful
touch
grasping
the
treasured
sword
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
swore
he
was
ready
to
throw
the
lawyers
in
the
river
with
a
sigh
of
relief
bonaparte
put
his
arm
through
lefèbvres
and
led
him
into
his
study
and
for
the
next
fourteen
years
he
remained
as
he
thought
the
confidential
righthand
man
of
the
greathearted
patriot
but
in
reality
the
tool
dupe
and
stalkinghorse
of
a
wily
adventurer

the
general
accompanied
napoleon
to
the
tuileries
and
listened
to
the
carefully
chosen
words
citizens
representatives
the
republic
is
perishing
you
know
it
well
and
your
decree
can
save
it
a
thousand
misfortunes
on
all
who
desire
trouble
and
disorder
i
will
oust
them
aided
by
all
the
friends
of
liberty
i
will
support
liberty
aided
by
general
lefèbvre
and
general
berthier
and
my
comrades
in
arms
who
share
my
feelings
we
wish
a
republic
founded
on
liberty
on
equality
on
the
sound
principles
of
national
representation
we
swear
this
i
swear
this
i
swear
in
my
own
name
and
in
the
name
of
my
comrades
in
arms
later
in
the
day
during
the
struggle
at
the
orangerie
it
was
lefèbvre
who
saved
lucien
bonaparte
and
cleared
the
hall
with
the
aid
of
some
grenadiers

from
the
18th
brumaire
napoleon
as
first
consul
and
later
as
emperor
held
in
lefèbvre
a
trump
card
whereby
he
could
defeat
any
attempted
hostile
combination
of
the
republicans
hence
it
was
that
at
the
time
of
the
proclamation
of
the
empire
he
included
him
in
his
list
of
marshals
to
prove
as
it
were
that
the
empire
was
merely
another
form
of
the
republic
later
still
for
the
same
reason
when
he
was
making
his
hierarchy
stronger
he
created
him
one
of
his
new
dukes

the
immediate
reward
for
lefèbvres
support
during
the
coup
détat
was
a
mission
to
the
west
to
extinguish
the
civil
war
in
la
vendée
the
general
was
lucky
in
surprising
a
considerable
force
of
rebels
at
alençon
and
soon
fulfilled
his
work
and
received
the
further
reward
of
a
seat
as
senator
which
brought
in
an
income
of
35000
francs
a
year
when
the
list
of
marshals
was
published
he
was
bracketed
with
kellermann
pérignon
and
serurier
as
marshals
whose
sphere
of
duty
would
lie
in
the
senate
as
such
at
the
coronation
of
the
emperor
in
notre
dame
he
held
the
sword
of
charlemagne
while
kellermann
carried
the
crown
strong
in
his
trust
of
him
napoleon
had
in
1803
created
him
prætor
of
the
senate
but
fortune
did
not
destine
that
he
should
long
enjoy
his
honours
in
peace
thanks
to
his
magnificent
physique
a
few
years
of
rest
entirely
restored
his
health
the
wound
which
in
1799
had
threatened
to
incapacitate
him
permanently
had
completely
healed
and
in
1806
he
once
again
found
himself
on
active
service
the
emperor
knew
well
that
the
marshal
was
a
sergeantmajor
rather
than
a
strategist
and
accordingly
placed
him
at
the
head
of
the
guard
where
his
powers
of
discipline
could
be
utilised
to
the
full
without
calling
on
him
to
solve
any
difficult
problems
at
jena
the
guard
had
plenty
of
hard
fighting
such
as
their
commander
loved
a
few
days
later
the
marshal
proved
that
the
guard
could
march
as
well
as
fight
when
at
nine
oclock
on
the
evening
of
october
24th
the
regiments
marched
into
potsdam
after
covering
fortytwo
miles
since
the
morning

early
in
1807
the
emperor
entrusted
the
marshal
with
the
siege
of
dantzig
a
strong
fortress
near
the
mouth
of
the
vistula
wellgarrisoned
by
a
prussian
force
of
fourteen
thousand
under
marshal
kalkreuth
lefèbvre
conscious
of
his
lack
of
engineering
skill
was
afraid
of
undertaking
the
task
but
the
emperor
promised
to
send
him
everything
necessary
and
to
guide
him
himself
to
the
camp
of
finkenstein
and
ultimately
said
goodbye
to
him
with
the
words
take
courage
you
also
must
have
something
to
speak
about
in
the
senate
when
we
return
to
france
the
siege
lasted
fiftyone
days
during
which
the
marshal
took
scarcely
a
moments
rest
ever
in
the
trenches
heading
every
possible
charge
calling
out
to
the
soldiers
come
on
children
its
our
turn
today
or
come
on
comrades
i
am
also
going
to
have
a
turn
at
fighting
such
treatment
worked
wonders
with
the
fiery
french
but
the
sluggish
men
of
baden
who
formed
a
considerable
part
of
his
force
were
not
accustomed
to
be
so
hustled
and
the
marshals
camp
manners
grated
on
the
prince
of
baden
who
considered
that
the
marshals
staff
was
mostly
composed
of
men
of
little
culture
and
that
his
son
held
the
first
place
among
those
who
had
no
manners
the
emperor
had
to
write
to
his
fiery
lieutenant
you
treat
our
allies
without
any
tact
they
are
not
accustomed
to
fire
but
that
will
come
do
you
think
that
our
men
are
as
good
now
as
in
1792that
we
can
be
as
keen
today
after
fifteen
years
war
pay
what
compliments
you
can
to
the
prince
of
baden

you
cannot
throw
down
walls
with
the
chests
of
your
grenadiers

let
your
engineers
do
their
work
and
be
patient
your
glory
is
to
take
dantzig
when
you
have
done
that
you
will
be
content
with
me
it
was
hard
for
the
marshal
to
show
patience
for
he
knew
but
one
way
to
do
a
thing
and
that
was
to
go
straight
at
it
as
hard
as
he
could
as
one
of
the
privates
said
the
marshal
is
a
brave
man
only
he
takes
us
for
horses
with
lannes
and
mortier
sent
to
reinforce
him
it
was
still
more
difficult
to
show
patience
but
the
end
came
and
on
the
fiftyfirst
day
of
the
siege
marshal
kalkreuth
surrendered
and
the
two
other
marshals
had
the
generosity
to
allow
lefèbvre
to
enjoy
alone
all
the
honours
of
the
conquest

in
the
next
year
the
emperor
had
determined
to
strengthen
his
throne
by
the
creation
of
a
new
nobility
it
was
important
to
see
how
republican
france
would
greet
this
scheme
and
accordingly
napoleon
determined
to
include
lefèbvre
among
his
new
dukes
one
day
the
emperor
sent
an
orderly
officer
with
orders
to
say
to
the
marshal
monsieur
le
duc
the
emperor
wishes
you
to
breakfast
with
him
and
asks
you
to
come
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
marshal
did
not
hear
the
title
and
merely
said
he
would
attend
when
he
entered
the
breakfastroom
the
emperor
went
up
to
him
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
goodmorning
monsieur
le
duc
sit
by
me
the
marshal
hearing
the
title
thought
he
was
joking
the
emperor
to
further
mystify
him
said
do
you
like
chocolate
monsieur
le
duc
yes
sire
replied
the
marshal
still
mystified
thereon
the
emperor
went
to
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
packet
labelled
chocolate
but
when
the
marshal
opened
the
box
he
found
it
contained
one
hundred
thousand
écus
in
bank
notes
while
in
the
army
the
new
duke
was
warmly
congratulated
on
his
honours
at
paris
the
smart
ladies
and
talleyrand
did
their
best
to
annoy
the
duchess
numerous
were
the
cruel
tales
they
spread
of
her
lack
of
breeding
and
of
her
amazon
ways
how
when
the
horses
bolted
with
her
carriage
she
seized
the
coachman
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
by
main
force
pulled
him
off
the
seat
and
herself
stopped
the
runaways
but
quite
unmoved
the
duchess
pursued
her
course
visiting
the
sick
giving
away
large
sums
to
charities
lending
a
helping
hand
to
any
friend
in
difficulties
and
as
usual
prefacing
her
remarks
by
when
i
used
to
do
the
washing

when
in
the
autumn
of
1808
napoleon
realised
how
serious
was
the
spanish
rising
he
despatched
his
guard
to
the
peninsula
under
the
duke
of
dantzig
but
the
war
brought
few
honours
to
any
one
and
the
marshal
proved
once
again
that
he
could
neither
act
independently
nor
assist
in
combinations
with
patience
he
nearly
spoiled
napoleons
whole
plan
of
campaign
by
a
premature
move
against
blake
prior
to
the
battle
of
espinosa
from
spain
the
guard
was
hurriedly
recalled
on
the
outbreak
of
the
austrian
campaign
of
1809
the
marshal
in
command
of
the
bavarian
allies
did
yeoman
service
under
napoleons
eye
during
the
great
five
days
fighting
he
was
present
also
at
wagram
and
immediately
after
that
battle
was
despatched
to
put
down
the
rising
in
the
tyrol
during
the
russian
campaign
he
once
again
commanded
the
guard
taking
part
in
all
the
hard
fighting
of
the
advance
and
also
in
the
horrors
of
the
retreat
though
in
his
fiftyeighth
year
the
tough
old
soldier
marched
on
foot
every
mile
of
the
way
from
moscow
to
the
vistula
and
shared
the
privations
of
his
men
watching
over
his
beloved
emperor
his
little
tondu
de
caporal
with
the
care
of
a
woman
himself
mounting
guard
over
him
at
night
and
surrounding
him
with
picked
men
of
the
guard
to
add
to
the
trials
of
that
dreadful
campaign
the
duke
lost
at
vilna
his
eldest
son
a
most
promising
young
soldier
who
had
already
reached
the
rank
of
general
this
blow
and
the
strain
of
the
retreat
were
too
much
for
him
and
he
was
unable
to
assist
the
emperor
in
the
campaign
of
1813
but
when
the
allies
invaded
the
sacred
soil
of
france
the
old
warrior
put
on
harness
again
and
fought
at
montmirail
arcissuraube
and
champaubert
where
he
had
his
horse
killed
under
him
at
montereau
he
fought
with
such
fury
that
the
foam
came
out
from
his
mouth

while
the
marshal
was
spending
his
lifeblood
in
the
field
the
duchess
in
paris
was
fighting
the
intrigues
of
the
royalist
ladies
when
an
insinuation
was
made
that
the
duke
might
be
won
over
from
the
emperor
the
duchess
despatched
a
friend
to
the
army
commanding
him
to
return
to
the
army
and
tell
my
husband
that
if
he
were
capable
of
such
infamy
i
should
take
him
by
the
hair
of
his
head
and
drag
him
to
the
emperors
feet
meanwhile
inform
him
of
the
intrigues
going
on
here
on
april
4th
the
end
came
the
marshals
refused
to
fight
any
longer
and
after
napoleons
abdication
lefèbvre
with
the
others
went
to
paris
to
treat
with
alexander
the
emperor
was
gone
but
france
remained
and
it
was
thanks
to
kellermann
and
lefèbvre
that
alsace
was
not
wrested
from
her
for
they
so
strongly
impressed
alexander
by
their
arguments
that
he
decided
to
oppose
the
prussians
who
desired
to
strip
france
of
her
eastern
provinces

the
marshal
swore
allegiance
to
the
bourbons
and
duly
received
the
cross
of
st
louis
and
his
nomination
as
peer
of
france
with
the
years
peace
came
time
for
reflection
and
he
began
to
see
that
son
petit
bonhomme
de
sire
as
he
called
napoleon
had
merely
used
him
as
a
political
pawn
in
his
endeavour
to
bind
the
republicans
to
the
wheel
of
the
imperial
chariot
accordingly
when
the
emperor
returned
from
elba
he
was
not
among
those
who
rushed
to
meet
him
still
although
he
had
no
personal
interview
with
the
emperor
during
the
hundred
days
he
so
far
compromised
himself
as
to
accept
a
seat
in
the
senate
for
this
conduct
he
was
under
a
cloud
for
the
first
years
of
the
second
restoration
but
in
1819
he
was
pardoned
and
restored
to
his
rank
and
office

from
1814
to
the
day
of
his
death
the
duke
of
dantzig
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
at
his
estate
at
combault
in
the
department
of
the
seine
and
marne
dispensing
that
hospitality
which
he
and
his
wife
loved
to
shower
on
all
who
had
met
with
misfortune
and
many
a
poor
soldier
and
halfpay
officer
owed
his
life
and
what
prosperity
he
had
to
the
generous
charity
of
the
duke
and
duchess
of
dantzig
his
death
on
september
14
1820
two
days
after
that
of
his
old
friend
kellermann
was
due
to
dropsy
arising
from
rheumatic
gout
brought
on
by
the
strain
of
the
russian
campaign

the
greatness
of
the
duke
of
dantzig
lay
not
so
much
in
his
soldierly
capacity
as
in
his
personal
character
his
military
renown
rested
largely
on
his
ability
to
carry
out
without
hesitation
and
jealousy
the
commands
of
others
by
his
personality
he
was
able
to
maintain
the
strictest
discipline
and
exact
the
last
ounce
from
his
troops
without
raising
a
murmur
his
men
loved
him
for
they
knew
that
he
shared
all
their
hardships
and
that
his
fingers
were
soiled
with
no
perquisites
or
secret
booty
it
was
no
empty
boast
when
he
wrote
to
the
directory
asking
bread
for
himself
and
rewards
for
his
officers
though
raised
to
ducal
rank
he
never
lost
his
sense
of
proportion
and
delighted
to
give
his
memories
of
when
i
was
sergeant
to
his
friends
and
to
the
officers
of
his
staff
still
he
was
intensely
proud
of
his
success
which
he
had
won
by
years
of
hard
work
and
he
knew
how
to
put
in
their
place
those
whose
fame
rested
solely
on
the
deeds
of
their
ancestors
telling
a
young
boaster
dont
be
so
proud
of
your
ancestors
i
am
an
ancestor
myself
though
he
ever
looked
an
old
alsatian
camp
boy
even
in
his
gorgeous
ducal
robes
though
his
manners
were
rough
and
he
would
not
hesitate
to
refuse
a
lift
to
a

the
words

nicolas
charles
oudinot
marshal
duke
of
reggio


nicolas
charles
oudinot
the
son
of
a
brewer
of
barleduc
was
born
on
april
23
1767
from
his
earliest
days
he
showed
that
spirit
of
bravado
which
later
distinguished
him
among
the
many
brave
men
who
attained
the
dignity
of
marshal
though
kindhearted
and
affectionate
his
fiery
character
led
him
into
much
disobedience
and
his
turbulent
nature
caused
many
a
sorrowful
hour
to
his
parents
still
it
was
with
sore
hearts
that
despite
their
entreaties
they
saw
him
march
gaily
off
in
1784
to
enlist
in
the
regiment
of
médoc
but
two
years
later
he
returned
home
tired
of
garrison
duty
and
greatly
to
his
parents
delight
entered
the
trade
when
in
1789
the
good
people
of
barleduc
began
to
organise
a
company
of
the
national
guard
young
oudinot
was
chosen
as
captain
and
for
the
next
two
years
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
politics
to
the
neglect
of
the
brewery
but
much
as
he
approved
of
the
spirit
of
the
revolution
he
was
no
advocate
of
mob
rule
and
he
used
his
company
of
citizen
soldiers
to
put
down
all
disturbances
in
the
town
later
still
in
1794
when
invalided
home
from
the
front
he
used
a
short
and
sharp
method
with
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of
the
terror
in
his
anger
he
seized
a
large
dish
of
haricot
and
effectually
stopped
the
praises
of
hébert
by
hurling
it
in
the
jacobins
face
in
september
1791
the
call
to
arms
summoned
the
fireeating
captain
of
the
national
guard
to
sterner
scenes
he
at
once
entered
the
volunteers
and
it
was
as
a
lieutenantcolonel
of
the
third
battalion
of
the
meuse
that
he
set
out
on
active
service
which
was
to
last
almost
continuously
for
twentytwo
years
and
from
which
he
was
to
emerge
with
the
proud
rank
of
marshal
the
title
of
duke
and
the
honourable
scars
of
no
less
than
thirtyfour
wounds

charles
oudinot
duke
of
reggio
from
an
engraving
after
the
painting
by
robert
le
fevre

his
campaigning
began
auspiciously
with
the
action
at
bitche
when
with
his
battalion
of
volunteers
he
captured
seven
hundred
prussians
and
a
standard
the
hard
fighting
in
the
rhine
valley
in
1793
added
greatly
to
his
reputation
but
it
was
at
morlantier
in
june
1794
that
his
gallant
action
made
his
name
resound
throughout
the
french
armies
the
division
of
general
ambert
was
attacked
on
both
flanks
oudinot
with
the
second
regiment
of
the
line
formed
the
advance
guard
but
not
perceiving
the
plight
of
the
main
body
he
continued
to
advance
the
enemy
surrounded
him
with
six
regiments
of
cavalry
forming
square
he
repulsed
every
assault
and
ultimately
fought
his
way
back
to
camp
with
but
slight
loss
and
recaptured
eight
french
standards
which
the
enemy
had
seized
when
they
surprised
amberts
division
ten
days
later
he
was
promoted
general
of
brigade
but
in
spite
of
his
glorious
exploit
the
officers
of
the
regiment
of
picardy
the
senior
regiment
of
the
old
royal
army
were
disgusted
at
being
commanded
by
a
young
brigadier
as
yet
but
twentyseven
years
old
and
sprung
from
the
ranks
calling
the
disaffected
officers
together
the
general
thus
addressed
them
gentlemen
is
it
because
i
do
not
bear
an
historic
name
that
you
wish
to
throw
me
over
for
your
old
titled
chiefs
or
is
it
because
you
think
i
am
too
young
to
hold
command
wait
till
the
next
engagement
and
then
judge
if
then
you
think
that
i
cannot
stand
fire
i
promise
to
hand
over
the
command
to
one
more
worthy
after
the
next
engagement
there
were
no
more
murmurs
against
the
general
and
officers
and
men
were
ready
to
follow
him
to
the
death
while
oudinot
thus
won
the
love
and
respect
of
his
command
he
requited
them
with
equal
love
but
his
way
of
showing
it
was
characteristic
of
the
man
as
he
used
to
say
in
later
years
ah
how
i
loved
them
i
know
full
well
i
loved
them
i
led
them
all
to
death
for
in
his
eyes
a
glorious
death
on
the
field
of
battle
was
what
the
true
soldier
desired
above
all
things
in
august
1794
a
fall
from
his
horse
which
broke
his
leg
placed
him
in
hospital
for
some
months
and
he
could
not
return
to
the
front
till
september
1795
he
arrived
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
capture
of
mannheim
but
a
month
later
at
neckerau
he
was
ridden
down
by
a
charge
of
the
enemys
cavalry
receiving
five
sabre
cuts
and
being
taken
prisoner
after
three
months
captivity
at
ulm
he
was
exchanged
the
campaigns
of
1796
and
1797
on
the
danube
added
to
the
number
of
his
wounds
in
1799
he
served
under
masséna
in
switzerland
and
gained
his
step
as
general
of
division
his
new
commander
formed
so
high
an
opinion
of
his
capacity
that
he
appointed
him
chief
of
his
staff
and
took
him
with
him
when
transferred
to
the
army
of
italy
it
was
a
new
rôle
for
the
fiery
oudinot
but
he
played
it
well
and
masséna
gave
him
but
his
due
when
he
wrote
to
the
directory
i
owe
the
greatest
praise
to
general
oudinot
my
chief
of
the
staff
whose
fiery
nature
though
restrained
to
endure
the
laborious
work
of
the
office
breaks
out
again
ever
ready
to
hand
on
the
field
of
battle
he
has
assisted
me
in
all
my
movements
and
has
seconded
me
to
perfection
during
the
disastrous
campaign
in
italy
in
1800
he
earned
the
further
thanks
of
his
chief
he
it
was
who
broke
the
blockade
at
genoa
and
penetrating
through
the
english
cruisers
successfully
carried
the
orders
to
suchet
on
the
var
and
returned
to
the
beleaguered
city
to
share
the
privations
of
the
army
by
now
his
name
was
well
known
to
friend
and
foe
alike
and
his
chivalrous
nature
was
admired
even
by
his
enemies
but
an
episode
occurred
during
the
siege
which
for
some
time
caused
his
name
to
be
execrated
by
the
austrians
the
french
had
captured
three
thousand
prisoners
during
the
sorties
round
genoa
at
the
command
of
masséna
oudinot
wrote
to
general
ott
to
explain
that
owing
to
famine
it
was
impossible
to
give
them
nourishment
and
asking
him
to
make
arrangements
for
feeding
them
ott
replied
that
the
siege
would
end
before
they
could
starve
with
their
own
soldiers
dying
of
hunger
at
their
posts
the
french
could
spare
but
little
food
for
the
miserable
prisoners
and
when
the
town
capitulated
there
was
hardly
one
left
alive
but
the
burden
of
this
calamity
falls
on
general
ott
and
masséna
and
not
on
oudinot
who
could
only
carry
out
the
orders
he
received

after
the
surrender
oudinot
went
home
on
sick
leave
but
was
back
in
italy
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
last
phase
of
the
war
under
general
brune
on
december
26th
at
monzembano
he
had
an
opportunity
of
showing
his
dashing
courage
an
austrian
battery
suddenly
coming
into
action
threw
the
french
into
disorder
oudinot
dashed
forward
collected
a
few
troopers
galloped
across
the
bridge
straight
at
the
austrian
guns
and
captured
one
of
them
with
his
own
hands
a
few
days
later
he
was
sent
home
to
paris
with
a
copy
of
the
armistice
signed
on
january
16
1801
arriving
in
paris
the
general
was
received
with
great
warmth
by
the
first
consul
who
gave
him
a
sword
of
honour
and
the
cannon
which
he
had
captured
at
monzembano

during
the
years
of
peace
which
followed
the
treaty
of
lunéville
general
oudinot
fell
entirely
under
the
influence
of
napoleon
his
frank
chivalrous
nature
was
captivated
by
the
bold
personality
of
the
corsican
so
great
in
war
so
attractive
in
peace
the
first
consul
rewarded
his
affection
by
giving
him
the
posts
of
inspectorgeneral
of
infantry
and
cavalry
while
not
engaged
in
these
duties
or
in
attendance
at
the
court
of
paris
the
general
spent
his
leisure
hours
at
his
home
at
barleduc
there
he
was
the
idol
of
the
populace
his
bust
adorned
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
his
fellowcitizens
were
never
tired
of
singing
his
praise
and
repeating
the
stories
of
his
marvellous
adventures
and
daring
escapades
but
no
one
who
first
saw
him
could
believe
that
this
was
oudinot
the
hero
of
all
these
marvellous
tales
there
was
nothing
of
the
swashbuckler
about
this
aristocraticlooking
man
spare
of
medium
height
whose
pale
intellectual
face
set
off
by
a
pair
of
brown
moustaches
revealed
a
rather
gentle
gracious
expression
over
which
flashed
occasionally
a
fugitive
smile
it
was
only
those
piercing
flashing
eyes
which
revealed
his
real
character
still
it
was
easy
to
understand
how
with
his
heroic
exploits
he
had
fascinated
both
friend
and
foe
and
gained
for
himself
the
title
of
the
young
bayard
by
his
first
wife
the
general
had
two
sons
and
two
daughters
the
daughters
married
early
generals
pajol
and
lorencz
but
it
was
his
sons
who
were
his
pride
he
had
sent
for
his
eldest
boy
at
the
age
of
eight
to
accompany
him
on
the
zurich
campaign
and
the
lad
had
at
that
age
to
perform
all
the
duties
of
a
subaltern
officer
during
the
year
of
peace
both
boys
were
constantly
with
their
father
who
spent
his
time
superintending
their
military
studies
and
building
for
himself
a
house
at
barleduc
from
this
patriarchal
life
he
was
recalled
in
1804
to
take
command
of
the
chosen
division
of
picked
grenadiers
which
had
been
organised
at
arras
by
junot
the
division
so
well
known
to
history
as
oudinots
grenadiers
or
the
infernal
column
was
composed
of
selected
men
from
every
regiment
and
next
to
the
guard
was
the
finest
division
in
the
imperial
army
in
the
campaign
of
1805
the
division
formed
part
of
lannes
corps
and
covered
itself
with
distinction
at
ulm
and
again
at
austerlitz
where
oudinot
was
present
though
not
in
command
he
had
been
wounded
at
hollabrünn
and
sent
to
hospital
and
his
division
entrusted
to
duroc
the
grand
marshal
of
the
palace
but
when
he
heard
of
the
approaching
engagement
the
fireeating
soldier
could
not
be
held
back
and
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
he
arrived
in
camp
duroc
chivalrously
offered
to
give
up
command
but
oudinot
who
was
satisfied
as
long
as
he
saw
fighting
would
not
hear
of
this
my
dear
marshal
he
said
remain
at
the
head
of
my
brave
grenadiers
we
will
fight
side
by
side
after
the
treaty
of
pressburg
he
was
sent
to
switzerland
to
take
possession
of
neuchâtel
which
had
been
ceded
to
france
by
prussia
to
form
a
fief
for
marshal
berthier
the
neuchâtelois
were
furious
at
being
treated
as
mere
pawns
in
the
game
and
trouble
was
expected
fortunately
oudinot
possessed
great
commonsense
he
saw
that
a
timely
concession
might
bind
the
proud
swiss
to
their
new
lord
the
people
of
neuchâtel
depended
almost
entirely
on
their
trade
with
england
and
he
wrung
from
napoleon
the
promise
that
this
trade
should
not
be
interfered
with
so
grateful
were
the
swiss
that
they
passed
a
law
making
oudinot
a
citizen
of
neuchâtel
the
general
returned
from
his
diplomatic
triumph
in
time
to
command
his
grenadiers
in
the
prussian
campaign
of
1806
and
gained
fresh
laurels
at
jena
ostralenka
dantzig
and
friedland
at
dantzig
with
his
own
hand
he
killed
a
russian
sergeant
who
had
caught
a
french
cavalry
colonel
in
an
ambush
at
friedland
he
was
with
lannes
when
the
marshal
surprised
the
russian
rear
and
held
them
pinned
against
the
town
until
napoleon
could
draw
in
his
troops
and
overwhelm
them
from
six
in
the
evening
till
twelve
next
day
the
grenadiers
fought
with
stubborn
tenacity
at
last
the
emperor
arrived
on
the
field
oudinot
with
his
coat
hanging
in
ribbons
from
musket
shots
his
horse
covered
with
blood
dashed
up
to
the
emperor
hasten
sire
he
cried
my
grenadiers
are
all
but
spent
but
give
me
some
reinforcements
and
i
will
hurl
all
the
russians
into
the
river
napoleon
replied
general
you
have
surpassed
yourself
you
seem
to
be
everywhere
but
you
need
not
worry
yourself
any
more
it
is
my
part
to
finish
this
affair

after
friedland
came
the
peace
of
tilsit
but
even
peace
has
its
dangers
soult
mortier
and
the
grave
davout
were
at
times
carried
away
by
oudinots
extravagant
spirits
and
used
to
amuse
themselves
after
dinner
by
extinguishing
the
candles
on
the
table
with
pistol
shots
during
the
day
the
general
spent
his
time
in
his
favourite
pursuit
of
riding
his
horses
were
always
thoroughbreds
and
nothing
stopped
him
once
he
had
decided
to
take
any
particular
line
so
one
day
while
attempting
to
jump
the
ditch
of
a
fort
instead
of
going
round
by
the
gate
his
horse
fell
with
him
and
he
broke
his
leg
and
had
to
be
sent
home
his
officers
and
comrades
gave
him
a
farewell
dinner
at
dessert
a
pâté
appeared
from
which
when
opened
by
general
rapp
a
swarm
of
birds
fluttered
out
with
collars
of
tricolour
ribbon
with
the
inscription
to
the
glory
of
general
oudinot

on
returning
home
the
emperor
in
addition
to
presenting
him
with
the
pipe
of
frederick
the
great
had
granted
him
the
title
of
count
and
a
donation
of
a
million
francs
with
part
of
this
sum
oudinot
bought
the
beautiful
estate
of
jeand
heurs
in
1808
he
was
selected
as
governor
of
erfurt
during
the
meeting
of
the
czar
and
napoleon
and
had
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
alexander
by
the
emperor
who
said
sire
i
present
you
the
bayard
of
the
french
army
like
the
preux
chevalier
he
is
without
fear
and
without
reproach
the
year
1809
brought
sterner
interludes
and
oudinot
was
present
in
command
of
his
grenadiers
during
the
five
days
fighting
and
at
aspernessling
on
the
death
of
lannes
he
was
promoted
to
the
command
of
the
second
corps
and
in
that
capacity
played
his
part
at
wagram
during
the
early
part
of
the
battle
it
took
all
his
selfrestraint
to
stand
still
while
davout
was
turning
the
austrian
left
but
when
he
saw
the
french
on
the
neusiedel
he
could
no
longer
control
his
impatience
and
without
waiting
orders
he
hurled
his
corps
against
the
enemys
centre
receiving
in
the
attack
two
slight
wounds
the
next
day
the
emperor
sent
for
him
do
you
know
what
you
did
yesterday
sire
i
hope
i
did
not
do
my
duty
too
badly
that
is
just
what
you
didyou
ought
to
be
shot
but
the
emperor
overlooked
his
impetuosity
and
a
week
later
rewarded
him
for
his
service
by
presenting
him
with
his
bâton
and
a
month
later
created
him
duke
of
reggio

the
duke
was
fortunate
in
not
being
selected
for
duty
in
spain
his
next
service
was
in
1812
when
he
commanded
a
corps
on
the
lines
of
communication
in
russia
this
was
his
first
independent
command
and
it
proved
that
though
a
good
subordinate
a
dashing
soldier
and
a
capable
diplomatist
he
did
not
possess
the
qualifications
of
a
great
general
at
polotsk
the
day
went
against
the
french
but
when
a
wound
caused
the
marshal
to
hand
over
his
command
to
st
cyr
that
able
officer
easily
stemmed
the
russian
advance
and
turned
defeat
into
victory
the
marshal
however
made
up
in
zeal
what
he
lacked
in
ability
a
few
weeks
later
hearing
that
st
cyr
was
wounded
he
hastened
back
to
the
front
it
was
owing
to
his
gallant
attack
on
the
russians
that
the
emperor
was
able
to
bridge
the
beresina
but
while
driving
off
the
enemy
who
were
attempting
to
stem
the
crossing
he
was
again
wounded
thanks
to
the
devotion
of
his
staff
he
was
safely
escorted
back
to
france
and
escaped
the
last
horrors
of
the
retreat
in
1813
the
duke
fought
at
bautzen
and
after
the
armistice
of
dresden
was
despatched
to
drive
back
the
mixed
force
of
swedes
and
prussians
who
were
threatening
the
french
left
under
bernadotte
the
action
of
grosbeeren
proved
once
again
that
the
duke
of
reggio
had
no
talent
for
independent
command
and
the
emperor
superseded
him
by
marshal
ney
whom
he
loyally
served
emerging
unscathed
from
the
slaughter
at
leipzig
he
fought
with
his
accustomed
fury
all
through
the
campaign
of
1814
without
adding
to
his
reputation
as
a
soldier
on
napoleons
abdication
the
duke
swore
allegiance
to
the
bourbons
who
received
him
with
warmth
as
in
the
early
years
of
the
revolutionary
wars
he
had
shown
great
humanity
to
the
captured
émigrés
louis
xviii
nominated
him
colonelgeneral
of
the
royal
corps
of
grenadiers
and
gave
him
command
of
the
third
military
division
with
headquarters
at
metz
it
was
there
that
the
marshal
first
heard
of
the
emperors
return
from
elba
he
at
once
set
out
to
try
and
intercept
his
advance
on
paris
but
his
troops
refused
to
act
against
their
former
leader
thereon
oudinot
threw
up
his
command
and
returned
to
jeand
heurs
on
his
arrival
at
paris
the
emperor
told
his
minister
of
war
davout
to
summon
the
duke
of
reggio
to
court
thinking
that
like
many
another
he
would
forget
his
oath
to
the
bourbons
but
the
duke
was
of
different
stuff
he
had
sworn
allegiance
to
louis
xviii
at
napoleons
command
but
he
could
not
break
his
oath
on
his
arrival
the
emperor
greeted
him
with
the
question
well
duke
of
reggio
what
have
the
bourbons
done
for
you
more
than
i
have
done
that
you
attempted
to
intercept
my
return
the
marshal
replied
that
he
had
plighted
his
oath
the
emperor
told
him
to
break
it
and
take
service
with
him
recalling
past
favours
the
marshal
was
much
affected
but
firm
i
will
serve
nobody
since
i
cannot
serve
you
he
said
but
trust
me
enough
not
to
spy
on
me
with
your
police
save
me
that
degradation
i
could
not
endure
it
so
the
interview
ended
and
the
marshal
returned
to
jeand
heurs

on
the
second
restoration
oudinot
became
a
great
favourite
of
the
bourbons
the
king
made
him
a
peer
of
france
presented
him
with
the
order
of
st
louis
created
him
one
of
the
four
majorgenerals
of
the
royal
guard
and
commandantinchief
of
the
national
guard
when
the
heir
to
the
throne
the
duke
of
berri
married
a
neapolitan
princess
the
second
wife
of
the
marshal
became
her
chief
lady
and
the
oudinots
husband
and
wife
served
the
royal
family
with
the
greatest
fidelity
the
marshal
once
again
saw
service
when
in
1823
he
commanded
the
first
corps
of
the
army
which
invaded
spain
it
was
through
no
fault
of
his
that
charles
x
lost
his
throne
for
he
was
patriotic
enough
to
tell
him
how
unfortunate
was
the
disbanding
of
the
national
guard
and
his
other
illadvised
actions

after
the
fall
of
the
bourbon
dynasty
in
1830
the
duke
of
reggio
never
again
entered
public
life
although
in
1839
louis
philippe
created
him
grand
chancellor
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
in
1842
governor
of
the
invalides
it
was
in
this
honoured
position
that
the
duke
breathed
his
last
on
september
13
1847
in
his
eightyfirst
year

the
duke
of
reggio
was
fortunate
in
his
career
he
never
saw
service
in
spain
and
he
seldom
held
independent
command
for
which
his
fiery
temper
and
impetuosity
unfitted
him
it
was
his
gallantry
and
intrepidity
which
won
for
him
his
bâton
in
a
subordinate
position
he
could
usually
control
himself
enough
to
obey
orders
in
a
subordinate
position
also
he
could
do
good
staff
work
and
his
quick
impetuous
brain
teemed
with
ideas
which
were
useful
to
his
superiors
but
by
himself
he
was
lost
napoleon
well
knew
his
shortcomings
in
1805
the
emperor
was
holding
a
review
oudinots
horse
was
restive
and
refused
to
march
past
whereon
he
drew
his
sword
and
stabbed
it
in
the
neck
that
evening
at
dinner
the
emperor
asked
is
that
the
way
you
manage
your
horse
sire
replied
oudinot
when
i
cannot
get
obedience
that
is
my
method
but
it
was
seldom
that
his
impetuosity
resulted
in
cruelty
and
the
wounded
at
friedland
and
in
many
another
action
had
cause
to
bless
him
the
hero
of
friedland
the
saviour
of
the
émigrés
and
the
administrator
of
neuchâtel
was
loved
not
only
in
the
french
army
but
also
among
the
enemy
at
erfurt
there
was
a
poor
saxon
gardener
who
delighted
to
cultivate
a
rose
which
he
called
oudinot
when
asked
the
reason
he
replied
the
general
has
made
me
love
the
war
which
has
ruined
me
the
duke
of
reggio
turned
his
face
steadily
against
plundering
and
would
reprimand
any
officer
who
recklessly
rode
over
a
field
of
wheat

old
age
did
not
change
his
character
happy
in
his
family
relations
adored
by
his
young
wife
he
was
universally
beloved
and
it
was
with
great
grief
that
on
september
13
1847
royalist
orleanist
imperialist
and
republican
learned
that
he
whom
the
soldiers
called
the
marshal
of
the
thirtyfour
wounds
had
passed
away




xxiv

dominique
catherine
de
pérignon
marshal


among
the
few
men
of
moderate
opinion
who
were
chosen
in
1791
to
represent
their
country
in
the
legislative
assembly
was
dominique
catherine
de
pérignon
the
scion
of
a
good
family
of
grenade
in
the
upper
garonne
neither
an
ultraroyalist
nor
ultrarepublican
he
was
a
man
of
action
rather
than
a
talker
one
year
spent
among
the
selfseekers
of
paris
was
sufficient
to
prove
to
him
that
his
rôle
did
not
lie
among
the
twisting
paths
of
partisan
statesmanship
and
gladly
in
1792
he
heard
the
summons
to
arms
and
left
the
forum
for
the
camp
now
thirtyeight
years
old
having
been
born
on
may
31
1754
this
was
not
his
first
experience
of
soldiering
he
had
held
a
commission
for
some
years
in
the
old
royal
army
and
had
served
on
the
staff
he
was
for
this
reason
at
once
elected
lieutenantcolonel
of
the
volunteer
legion
of
the
pyrenees
his
bravery
and
his
former
military
training
soon
caused
him
to
rise
among
the
mass
of
ignorant
and
untrained
volunteers
who
formed
the
army
of
the
pyrenees
luckily
for
france
she
was
opposed
on
her
western
frontier
by
an
army
which
knew
as
little
of
war
as
her
own
led
by
officers
of
equal
ignorance
without
the
stimulus
of
burning
enthusiasm
and
the
dread
power
of
the
guillotine
had
it
been
otherwise
perpignan
and
the
fortresses
covering
provence
would
soon
have
been
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
with
all
europe
threatening
the
eastern
frontier
and
civil
war
at
home
the
government
could
spare
but
few
troops
and
these
the
least
trained
for
the
defence
of
the
west
accordingly
in
the
opening
fights
of
the
campaign
illconceived
plans
and
panics
too
frequently
caused
the
defeat
of
the
french
and
it
was
often
only
the
personal
example
of
individuals
which
saved
the
army
from
absolute
annihilation
from
the
first
engagement
pérignon
made
his
mark
by
his
coolness
and
courage
the
french
attack
on
the
spanish
position
at
serre
had
been
brought
to
a
halt
by
the
fierce
fire
of
the
enemy
and
as
the
line
wavered
a
timely
charge
of
the
spanish
horse
threw
it
into
confusion
pérignon
commanding
the
first
line
rushed
up
and
seized
the
musket
and
cartridges
of
a
wounded
soldier
and
collecting
a
few
undaunted
privates
quietly
opened
fire
on
the
spanish
cavalry
and
by
his
example
shamed
the
runaways
into
returning
to
the
attack
for
this
he
was
created
general
of
brigade
on
july
28
1793
by
september
the
enemy
had
opened
their
trenches
round
perpignan
and
pérignon
was
entrusted
with
a
night
sortie
on
approaching
the
spanish
line
a
fusillade
of
musketry
swept
down
five
hundred
of
his
little
force
and
his
men
at
once
halted
and
opened
fire
but
pérignon
believed
in
the
bayonet
with
stinging
reproaches
he
again
got
his
men
to
advance
and
sweeping
over
the
enemys
entrenchments
he
drove
them
in
rout
and
captured
their
camp
he
thus
won
his
promotion
as
lieutenantgeneral

in
november
of
1794
dugommier
the
french
commanderinchief
fell
mortally
wounded
at
the
battle
of
montagnenoire
and
pérignon
was
at
once
appointed
his
successor
though
no
great
strategist
or
tactician
he
was
an
able
leader
of
men
and
had
the
faculty
of
enforcing
obedience
to
his
orders
trusting
entirely
to
the
bayonet
he
forced
the
fortified
lines
of
escola
making
his
troops
advance
and
charge
over
the
entrenchments
with
shouldered
arms
without
firing
a
shot
the
fortresses
of
figueras
and
rosas
alone
barred
the
advance
of
the
french
into
catalonia
so
demoralised
were
the
enemy
that
figueras
with
all
its
immense
stores
nine
thousand
troops
and
two
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
capitulated
to
a
mere
summons
but
rosas
stood
firm
covered
on
the
land
side
by
the
fort
of
le
bouton
on
the
top
of
a
precipice
and
on
the
sea
side
swept
by
the
guns
of
the
spanish
squadron
anchored
in
the
roads
the
fort
of
le
bouton
was
called
limprenable
but
pérignon
was
not
frightened
by
names
although
greatly
hampered
by
the
civil
commissioners
with
the
army
and
held
by
them
as
suspect
he
determined
to
capture
le
bouton
and
rosas
le
bouton
was
dominated
by
a
perpendicular
rock
two
thousand
feet
high
it
was
certain
that
if
batteries
could
be
established
on
this
precipice
le
bouton
could
be
taken
but
the
artillerymen
believed
that
it
was
impossible
to
construct
a
road
to
haul
guns
up
to
this
height
very
well
then
it
is
the
impossible
that
i
am
going
to
do
replied
the
obstinate
little
general
and
after
immense
toil
a
zigzag
road
was
constructed
and
the
guns
hauled
by
hand
to
the
summit
after
a
severe
bombardment
le
bouton
was
carried
by
an
assault
but
still
rosas
held
out
the
weather
was
very
severe
and
the
snow
came
above
the
soldiers
thighs
and
the
engineers
declared
that
it
was
impossible
to
construct
siege
works
unless
a
certain
outlying
redoubt
was
first
taken
very
well
said
the
general
make
your
preparations
tomorrow
i
will
take
it
at
the
head
of
my
grenadiers
so
at
five
oclock
the
next
morning
february
1
1795
the
grenadiers
with
their
general
at
their
head
marched
out
of
camp
and
under
a
murderous
fire
by
eight
oclock
captured
the
outlying
redoubt
so
after
a
siege
of
sixtyone
days
rosas
was
captured
it
was
the
personality
of
their
general
which
had
taught
the
french
soldiers
to
surmount
all
difficulties
absolutely
fearless
himself
full
of
grim
determination
he
taught
his
soldiers
how
to
acquire
these
virtues
by
example
not
by
precept
ever
exposing
himself
to
danger
showing
absolute
callousness
until
his
men
were
shamed
into
following
his
example
on
one
occasion
during
the
siege
a
shell
fell
at
his
feet
with
the
match
still
fizzling
he
was
at
the
moment
directing
some
troops
who
were
exposed
to
the
fire
the
men
called
out
to
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
explosion
and
throw
himself
flat
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
bomb
and
quietly
went
on
giving
his
orders
for
he
knew
how
his
example
would
steady
his
troops
meanwhile
someone
dashed
up
and
extinguished
the
match
before
the
bomb
could
explode

the
peace
of
basle
prevented
pérignon
from
gaining
any
further
success
in
spain
and
the
directors
out
of
compliment
appointed
him
ambassador
to
the
court
of
madrid
where
his
good
sense
and
moderation
did
much
to
strengthen
the
peace
between
the
two
countries
in
1799
he
was
sent
to
command
a
division
of
the
army
of
italy
and
commanded
the
left
wing
at
the
battle
of
novi
while
attempting
to
cover
the
rout
he
was
ridden
over
by
the
enemys
horse
and
taken
prisoner
with
eight
honourable
sabre
wounds
on
his
arms
and
chest
when
the
russian
surgeon
was
going
to
attend
to
his
wounds
thinking
more
of
others
than
of
himself
he
said
to
him
do
not
worry
about
me
look
first
after
those
brave
men
there
who
are
in
a
worse
plight
than
i
after
a
few
months
his
exchange
was
effected
and
he
returned
to
france
severely
shaken
in
health
and
not
fit
for
further
active
service
to
find
bonaparte
first
consul
though
not
one
of
his
own
followers
bonaparte
recognised
the
services
he
had
rendered
to
his
country
and
arranged
for
his
entry
into
the
senate
and
in
1802
appointed
him
commissioner
extraordinary
to
arrange
the
negotiation
with
spain
a
delicate
compliment
to
pérignon
who
had
made
his
name
on
spanish
soil
further
to
recall
his
spanish
victories
in
1804
the
emperor
created
him
honorary
marshal
not
on
the
active
list
and
later
gave
him
the
title
of
count
but
though
napoleon
did
not
think
that
the
marshal
was
physically
fit
to
command
again
in
the
field
he
entrusted
him
in
1801
with
the
government
of
parma
and
piacenza
and
in
1808
sent
him
to
naples
to
command
the
french
troops
stationed
in
the
kingdom
of
his
brotherinlaw
murat
the
task
was
a
difficult
one
for
murat
was
no
easy
person
to
get
on
with
and
southern
italy
from
the
days
of
hannibal
has
been
a
hard
place
in
which
to
maintain
military
virtues
but
the
marshal
with
his
sound
commonsense
gave
satisfaction
both
to
napoleon
and
to
king
joachim
and
at
the
same
time
kept
a
tight
hand
over
his
troops
when
however
in
1814
murat
deserted
the
emperor
the
old
marshal
withdrew
in
sorrow
to
france
to
find
paris
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
like
the
other
marshals
he
accepted
the
restoration
and
was
created
a
peer
of
france
being
himself
of
noble
birth
and
an
exofficer
of
the
old
royal
army
louis
xviii
appointed
him
to
investigate
the
claims
and
verify
the
services
of
the
officers
of
the
old
army
who
had
returned
to
france
at
the
restoration
when
in
1815
napoleon
returned
from
elba
the
marshal
who
was
at
his
country
house
near
toulouse
made
every
effort
to
organise
resistance
against
him
in
the
midi
during
the
hundred
days
he
remained
quietly
at
his
home
and
on
the
second
restoration
was
rewarded
with
the
command
of
the
first
military
division
and
created
marquis
and
commander
of
the
order
of
st
louis
but
he
did
not
long
enjoy
his
new
honours

jean
mathieu
philibert
serurier
marshal


after
thirtyfour
years
service
to
be
still
a
captain
with
no
probable
chance
of
promotion
such
was
the
lot
of
serurier
when
the
revolution
broke
out
in
1789
born
on
december
8
1742
he
had
received
his
first
commission
in
the
militia
at
the
age
of
thirteen
and
from
there
had
been
transferred
to
the
line
his
war
service
was
not
inconsiderable
including
three
campaigns
in
hanover
one
in
portugal
and
one
in
italy
he
had
been
wounded
as
far
back
as
the
action
of
wartburg
in
1760
but
there
was
no
court
influence
to
bring
him
his
majority
with
the
revolution
however
fortune
quickly
changed
the
years
of
steady
attention
to
duty
of
patient
devotion
to
and
loving
care
of
his
men
brought
their
reward
and
when
promotion
became
the
gift
of
the
soldiers
and
not
of
the
courtiers
the
stern
old
disciplinarian
found
himself
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
in
the
handtohand
struggles
which
distinguished
the
early
campaigns
in
the
alps
he
soon
acquired
a
reputation
for
bravery
and
the
clever
handling
of
his
men
by
june
1795
he
had
risen
to
be
general
of
division
in
which
capacity
he
distinguished
himself
on
july
7th
by
the
way
he
led
his
division
at
the
fight
for
the
col
de
tenda
and
for
the
modesty
with
which
he
attributed
all
his
success
to
his
soldiers
a
month
later
he
saved
the
whole
army
at
the
col
de
pierre
étroite
when
under
the
cover
of
driving
rain
and
mist
the
enemy
surprised
the
french
line
of
picquets
at
midnight
and
had
all
but
seized
the
position
it
was
serurier
who
collecting
three
hundred
and
fifty
men
hurled
himself
against
the
enemys
column
of
fifteen
hundred
bayonets
and
by
sheer
handtohand
fighting
held
them
in
check
for
six
hours
and
at
last
repulsed
them
with
the
loss
of
a
considerable
number
of
prisoners

with
the
halo
of
this
action
still
surrounding
him
in
march
1796
he
first
came
into
direct
connection
with
bonaparte
the
new
commanderinchief
quickly
took
measure
of
his
tall
stern
subordinate
while
recognising
to
the
full
his
bravery
the
excellent
discipline
he
knew
how
to
maintain
and
the
high
regard
in
which
he
was
held
by
his
division
he
saw
that
the
iron
of
years
of
subordination
had
entered
into
the
old
soldiers
soul
and
that
while
he
could
be
relied
on
to
obey
orders
implicitly
he
never
could
be
trusted
with
an
independent
command
still
what
bonaparte
most
required
from
his
subordinates
was
immediate
obedience
and
speedy
performance
of
orders
and
consequently
serurier
played
no
insignificant
part
in
the
glorious
campaign
of
1796
at
mondovi
he
showed
his
stubbornness
when
the
sardinian
general
turned
at
bay
and
as
bonaparte
wrote
to
the
directory
the
victory
was
due
entirely
to
serurier
when
the
austrians
were
driven
into
mantua
bonaparte
entrusted
him
with
the
siege
the
austrian
forces
in
the
fortress
numbered
some
fourteen
thousand
serurier
had
but
ten
thousand
to
carry
on
the
siege
although
the
usual
estimate
is
that
a
besieging
force
should
be
three
times
as
strong
as
the
besieged
but
by
his
clever
use
of
the
marshes
and
bridges
he
was
able
to
hold
the
enemy
and
open
his
trenches
and
siege
batteries
it
was
no
fault
of
his
that
on
the
advance
of
würmser
he
had
to
abandon
his
guns
and
hasten
to
castiglione
for
bonaparte
had
given
him
no
warning
of
the
sudden
advance
of
the
austrian
relieving
force
after
castiglione
he
returned
to
his
task
round
mantua
and
gallantly
repulsed
all
sorties
when
the
end
came
he
had
the
honour
of
superintending
the
surrender
and
of
receiving
the
parole
from
the
gallant
old
marshal
würmser
and
the
austrian
officers
in
the
advance
on
vienna
his
division
distinguished
itself
in
the
terrible
march
to
asola
but
as
bonaparte
said
the
wind
and
the
rain
were
always
the
crown
of
victory
for
the
army
of
italy
at
gradisca
serurier
captured
two
thousand
five
hundred
prisoners
eight
stands
of
colours
and
ten
pieces
of
artillery
and
again
crowned
himself
with
glory
at
the
col
de
tarvis
in
june
bonaparte
sent
the
old
warrior
to
paris
to
present
twentytwo
captured
stands
to
the
directory
and
in
his
despatches
after
enumerating
his
triumphs
from
mondovi
to
gradisca
he
finished
by
saying
general
serurier
is
extremely
severe
on
himself
and
at
times
on
others
a
stern
enforcer
of
discipline
order
and
the
most
necessary
virtues
for
the
maintenance
of
society
he
disdains
intrigues
and
intriguers
he
then
proceeded
to
demand
for
him
the
command
of
the
troops
of
the
cisalpine
republic
but
the
directors
had
other
designs
and
sent
back
the
general
to
command
the
captured
province
of
venice

in
1799
when
the
austrians
and
russians
invaded
northern
italy
serurier
commanded
a
division
of
the
army
of
occupation
during
the
operations
which
ended
in
the
enemy
forcing
the
adda
his
division
got
isolated
from
the
main
body
the
old
soldier
whose
boast
was
that
he
never
turned
his
back
on
an
enemy
forgetful
of
strategy
and
thinking
only
of
honour
instead
of
attempting
to
escape
and
rejoin
the
rest
of
the
army
took
possession
of
an
extremely
strong
position
at
verderio
and
soon
found
himself
surrounded
after
a
gallant
fight
against
an
enemy
three
times
his
number
he
was
compelled
to
surrender
with
seven
thousand
men
the
celebrated
suvaroff
the
russian
commander
treated
him
with
great
kindness
and
invited
him
to
dine
after
his
exchange
on
parole
had
been
arranged
the
russian
general
asked
him
where
he
was
going
to
paris
so
much
the
better
replied
suvaroff
i
shall
count
on
seeing
you
there
soon
i
have
myself
always
hoped
to
see
you
there
replied
serurier
with
considerable
wit
and
dignity

the
general
was
still
a
prisoner
on
parole
when
bonaparte
returned
from
egypt
and
at
once
gladly
placed
himself
at
his
disposal
and
aided
him
during
the
coup
détat
of
brumaire
it
was
because
of
this
service
and
of
the
strong
affection
which
the
old
warrior
bore
him
that
bonaparte
piled
honours
upon
him
for
serurier
had
undoubtedly
done
less
than
anybody
save
perhaps
bessières
to
deserve
his
bâton
still
napoleon
knew
his
devotion
his
blind
obedience
to
orders
and
his
absolute
integrity
in
december
1799
he
called
him
to
the
senate
in
april
1804
he
made
him
governor
of
the
invalides
and
a
month
later
presented
him
with
his
marshals
bâton
and
created
him
grand
eagle
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
grand
cross
of
the
iron
crown
but
he
never
employed
him
in
the
field
though
once
for
a
short
time
during
the
walcheren
expedition
he
placed
him
in
command
of
the
national
guard
of
paris

the
old
marshal
found
a
congenial
occupation
in
looking
after
the
veterans
at
the
invalides
while
as
vicepresident
of
the
senate
he
faithfully
served
the
interests
of
his
beloved
emperor
when
in
1814
he
heard
that
paris
was
going
to
surrender
rather
than
that
the
trophies
of
his
masters
glory
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
on
the
night
of
march
30th
he
collected
the
eighteen
hundred
captured
standards
which
adorned
nôtre
dame
and
the
military
trophies
from
the
chapel
of
the
invalides
and
burned
them
and
he
actually
hurled
into
the
fire
the
sword
of
the
great
frederick
which
had
been
seized
in
1806
at
potsdam
yet
in
spite
of
his
devotion
to
the
emperor
a
few
days
later
he
took
part
in
the
proceedings
in
the
senate
and
voted
for
his
deposition
under
the
restoration
he
was
made
a
peer
of
france
but
on
napoleons
return
he
hastened
to
greet
him
but
the
emperor
could
not
forgive
his
desertion
and
thinking
he
would
not
benefit
by
his
services
he
refused
them
when
the
bourbons
returned
a
second
time
the
marshal
was
stripped
of
his
titles
and
what
caused
him
more
grief
of
his
command
of
the
invalides
after
parting
from
the
veterans
whose
welfare
he
had
so
long
superintended
the
old
warrior
withdrew
into
private
life
and
died
at
paris
on
december
21
1819
at
the
age
of
seventyseven

joseph
poniatowski
the
nephew
of
king
stanislaus
the
erstwhile
lover
of
catherine
the
second
of
russia
was
born
in
1762
before
his
uncle
had
been
raised
to
the
kingly
rank
like
all
poles
of
noble
birth
war
and
war
alone
could
offer
him
a
profession
he
was
able
or
cared
to
pursue
and
accordingly
at
an
early
age
he
served
his
apprenticeship
in
arms
under
the
banner
of
austria
returning
to
his
native
country
in
1789
with
the
experience
of
several
campaigns
against
the
turks
he
was
entrusted
by
his
uncle
with
the
organisation
of
the
polish
army
for
the
castoff
lover
of
the
great
catherine
was
about
to
make
one
last
effort
to
save
his
country
from
the
greedy
hands
of
prussia
russia
and
austria
the
great
kingdom
of
poland
had
fallen
on
evil
days
she
had
no
fortresses
no
navy
no
roads
no
arsenals
no
revenue
and
no
real
standing
army
while
the
king
was
elected
by
a
diet
of
nobles
who
thought
more
of
foreign
gold
than
of
patriotism
the
single
vote
of
one
member
of
this
diet
could
bring
all
business
to
a
standstill
king
stanislaus
reforms
were
wise
but
they
came
too
late
the
kingship
was
to
become
hereditary
the
liberum
veto
whereby
business
was
paralysed
was
abolished
and
a
standing
army
was
to
be
raised
but
it
suited
none
of
her
great
neighbours
to
see
poland
organising
herself
into
a
modern
state
and
before
prince
joseph
had
had
time
to
raise
and
thoroughly
drill
his
new
model
army
prussia
and
russia
determined
once
and
for
all
to
wipe
the
kingdom
off
the
map
of
europe
in
1792
prince
joseph
found
himself
at
the
head
of
his
new
levies
opposed
by
the
trained
troops
of
those
countries
to
add
to
his
difficulties
the
orders
he
received
from
his
uncle
were
contradictory
and
irresolute
for
king
stanislaus
though
patriot
at
heart
had
not
the
moral
courage
for
so
great
an
emergency
the
new
polish
troops
gained
some
minor
successes
but
before
the
immense
array
of
enemies
the
kings
heart
failed
him
and
he
signed
the
convention
of
targowitz
which
foreshadowed
the
dismemberment
of
his
country
prince
joseph
like
many
another
of
his
brave
comrades
unable
to
stomach
such
cowardice
threw
up
his
commission
and
withdrew
into
exile
in
1794
poland
suddenly
flew
to
arms
at
the
command
of
the
greathearted
kosciuszko
and
prince
joseph
keen
soldier
and
patriot
gladly
placed
himself
under
the
orders
of
his
former
subordinate
and
covered
himself
with
glory
at
the
siege
of
warsaw
again
however
the
polish
resistance
was
broken
down
by
force
of
numbers
and
the
prince
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
blandishments
of
emperor
and
czarina
alike
withdrew
from
public
life
and
settled
down
to
manage
his
estates
near
warsaw
for
eleven
long
years
poland
lay
dismembered
but
the
national
spirit
still
smouldered
and
broke
into
clear
flame
when
in
1806
the
victorious
french
drove
the
battered
remains
of
the
prussian
armies
across
the
vistula
but
poland
was
a
mere
pawn
in
the
game
to
be
used
as
a
means
of
threatening
or
conciliating
russia
and
in
spite
of
the
high
hopes
of
the
poles
the
treaty
of
tilsit
instead
of
reviving
the
ancient
kingdom
merely
established
a
grand
duchy
of
warsaw
the
emperor
left
davout
to
watch
over
the
weaning
of
the
state
and
appointed
prince
joseph
to
organise
the
national
forces
which
were
to
supplement
the
french
army
of
occupation
no
better
choice
could
have
been
made
for
the
prince
had
the
necessary
tact
to
manage
the
imperious
davout
while
his
chivalrous
nature
his
wellknown
patriotism
and
his
experience
and
ability
enabled
him
once
more
to
accustom
the
polish
troops
to
the
bit
of
discipline
when
in
1809
the
great
european
conflagration
forced
napoleon
to
leave
the
grand
duchy
to
its
fate
prince
joseph
was
able
to
keep
the
austrians
in
check
and
actually
to
penetrate
into
galicia
before
the
battle
of
wagram
brought
the
war
to
an
end

poniatowskis
campaign
against
austria
glorious
as
it
was
for
the
poles
was
in
reality
the
forerunner
of
disaster
during
the
campaign
the
polish
troops
were
supported
by
a
russian
division
to
poniatowski
the
russians
the
despoilers
of
his
country
were
more
hateful
than
the
enemy
and
he
so
distrusted
them
that
at
the
risk
of
having
to
fight
them
he
refused
to
allow
them
to
occupy
any
of
the
captured
fortresses
this
suspicion
was
increased
by
the
capture
of
a
secret
despatch
from
the
russian
commander
to
the
austrian
archduke
congratulating
him
on
the
victory
of
razyn
and
expressing
a
wish
that
his
standards
might
soon
be
joined
to
the
austrian
eagles
the
prince
at
once
sent
the
intercepted
despatch
to
napoleon
who
summed
up
the
situation
with
the
words
i
see
that
after
all
i
must
make
war
on
alexander
so
when
the
grand
army
assembled
for
the
invasion
of
russia
prince
poniatowski
with
his
poles
rejoiced
at
the
call
to
arms
and
brought
thirtysix
thousand
well
disciplined
and
well
equipped
troops
to
the
rendezvous
while
sixtyfive
thousand
were
left
to
garrison
the
fortresses
the
years
of
peace
had
been
spent
by
him
in
busy
labour
as
minister
of
war
providing
for
the
necessities
of
the
army
establishing

smolensk
moskowa
and
many
a
skirmish
proved
that
the
labour
of
organisation
had
not
sapped
prince
josephs
dash
and
courage
and
the
horrors
of
the
retreat
brought
out
to
the
full
his
chivalrous
bravery
and
determination
though
wounded
during
the
retreat
he
was
ready
the
following
year
to
help
the
french
in
central
europe
on
the
morning
of
the
first
day
of
the
battle
of
leipzig
napoleon
to
fire
the
poles
sent
their
prince
his
bâton
as
marshal
while
esteeming
the
honour
prince
joseph
showed
no
undue
elation
for
much
as
he
admired
the
french
and
grateful
as
he
felt
he
was
at
heart
a
pole
and
as
he
said
to
a
comrade
i
am
proud
to
be
the
leader
of
the
poles
when
one
has
a
unique
title
superior
to
that
of
marshal
the
title
of
generalissimo
of
the
poles
nothing
else
matters
besides
i
am
going
to
die
and
i
prefer
to
die
as
a
polish
general
and
not
as
a
marshal
of
france
but
the
marshal
did
not
allow
his
gloomy
forebodings
to
interfere
with
his
duty
and
so
fiercely
did
he
face
the
enemy
that
after
three
days
fighting
his
corps
had
dwindled
from
seven
thousand
to
a
bare
two
thousand
men
on
the
morning
of
the
fatal
19th
of
october
the
emperor
sent
for
him
and
entrusted
him
with
the
defence
of
the
southern
suburb
of
leipzig
sire
said
the
prince
i
have
but
few
followers
left
what
then
rejoined
the
emperor
you
will
defend
it
with
what
you
have
ah
sire
replied
the
prince
marshal
we
are
all
ready
to
die
for
your
majesty
thus
spoke
the
pole
but
many
a
frenchman
thought
otherwise
and
hurried
from
the
stricken
field
with
their
hated
enemies
the
austrians
russians
and
prussians
surrounding
them
the
small
band
of
devoted
poles
fought
to
the
last
when
the
bridge
was
blown
up
and
ordered
retreat
was
impossible
the
prince
drawing
his
sword
called
out
to
those
around
him
gentlemen
we
must
die
with
honour
severely
wounded
with
a
handful
of
followers
he
fought
his
way
through
a
column
of
the
enemy
and
reached
the
bank
of
the
elster
faint
from
loss
of
blood
he
urged
his
horse
into
the
stream
and
by
great
exertions
reached
the
other
side
but
the
beast
worn
out
by
the
long
days
of
battle
was
unable
to
clamber
up
the
steep
slippery
bank
and
the
prince
marshal
was
so
faint
that
he
could
no
longer
guide
his
steed
so
horse
and
rider
dropped
back
into
the
stream
and
were
seen
no
more
alive
two
days
later
his
body
was
recovered
and
buried
with
all
the
honours
due
to
his
rank
in
the
presence
of
the
allied
sovereigns
his
former
enemies
thus
passed
away
prince
joseph
poniatowski
whose
chivalrous
courage
had
won
for
him
the
title
of
the
polish
bayard
whose
life
had
been
spent
for
the
welfare
of
his
country
whose
high
military
reputation
was
sullied
by
no
inglorious
act
and
who
at
the
last
chose
death
rather
than
surrender
