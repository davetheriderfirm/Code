First function only checks the first letter as it returns in either case.

Second function always returns True as string 'c' is lowercase (the variable c is not tested).

Third function checks every letter in turn but by the time it returns, flag relates to the final letter check, so only the final letter matters.

Fourth function works!

Fifth function returns False as soon as it finds a letter that is not lower case, so only returns True if all letters are lower case.
